## The Southall and Brent Revisited (SABRE) Study

The SABRE study is a longitudinal cohort established to investigate cardiovascular and metabolic health disparities in a multi-ethnic population in West London. Participants were recruited between 1988 and 1991 and have been followed over three decades, providing rich life-course data on:

- Cardiovascular risk factors and outcomes  
- Diabetes and metabolic health  
- Lifestyle and social determinants of health  
- Ethnic differences in disease prevalence and progression

## Scientific Contributions

The SABRE study provides insights into:

- Ethnic differences in cardiometabolic risk and disease trajectories  
- Early-life and mid-life determinants of cardiovascular disease  
- Long-term patterns of glucose regulation, blood pressure, and obesity  

Findings from SABRE have contributed to national and international guidelines for cardiovascular and metabolic health, particularly in multi-ethnic populations.

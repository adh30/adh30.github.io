## VITAL: Virtual Twins for Personalised Clinical Care

[VITAL](https://vital-horizoneurope.eu/) aims to develop a multi-scale, multi-organ modelling platform to support precision medicine by integrating patient-specific clinical measurements with wearable technology data. The platform allows for:

- Personalized simulations of cardiovascular, metabolic, and physiological systems  
- Predictive modeling for disease progression and treatment response  
- Integration of longitudinal clinical data with real-time monitoring  

The project aims to provide actionable insights for clinicians and researchers, enabling data-driven, individualized care strategies.

## Clinical Applications

- Supports personalized diagnosis and risk prediction  
- Guides treatment planning and intervention strategies  
- Provides an adaptable framework for research across multiple organ systems  


## Key Publications and outputs

- To be added

I'm Professor of Cardiovascular Physiology and Pharmacology at UCL

My research interests include haemodynamics, wave intensity analysis, blood pressure and cardiometabolic health.

I am currently also Head of the Department of Population Science & Experimental Medicine in UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, Director of the British Heart Foundation 4-year PhD programme at UCL, and Associate Director of the MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL.

Previously I worked at Imperial College London as a Professor of Clinical Pharmacology.

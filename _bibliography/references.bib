   abstract = {1. The role of chloride and bicarbonate in the control of intracellular pH (pHi) was assessed in segments of rat mesenteric resistance arteries (internal diameter about 200 microns) by measurements of chloride efflux with 36Cl-, of pHi with the pH-sensitive dye 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5 (and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) and of membrane potential with intracellular electrodes. 2. The main questions addressed were whether the previously demonstrated sodium-coupled uptake of bicarbonate in these arteries was also coupled to chloride efflux, and whether sodium-independent Cl(-)-HCO3- exchange was present and played a role in regulation of pHi. 3. The 36Cl- efflux was unaffected by acidification induced by an NH4Cl pre-pulse in the presence as well as in the absence of bicarbonate. This was also true in sodium-free media and in vessels depolarized by high potassium. 4. The membrane potential was unaffected by the acidification associated with wash-out of NH4Cl, and the net acid extrusion during recovery of pHi from the acidification was not affected significantly by depolarization. 5. In the absence of bicarbonate, omission of extracellular chloride caused no change in pHi, but reduced 36Cl- efflux. By contrast, in the presence of bicarbonate, omission of chloride caused an increase in pHi but no change in 36Cl- efflux. Furthermore, the anion transport inhibitor 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid (DIDS) inhibited the increase in pHi seen in the presence of bicarbonate and reduced the 36Cl- efflux in the presence of bicarbonate. 6. The presence of bicarbonate had no significant effect on the rate of recovery of pHi or the rate of increase of intracellular acid equivalents after an NH4Cl induced alkalinization; also the buffering power was not significantly different in the absence and presence of bicarbonate. Moreover these parameters were not significantly affected by DIDS, although DIDS as previously demonstrated reduced the rate of recovery of pHi from acidification. 7. The membrane potential was not significantly affected by the alkalinization associated with addition of NH4Cl and the rate of recovery of pHi from the alkalinization was not affected by depolarization. 8. The effects of NH4Cl and PCO2 on 36Cl- efflux were complex and could not easily be explained by the changes in pHi.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

   abstract = {Pressure waveforms measured at different locations in the cardiovascular system present a very similar diastolic decay. Previous work has shown the cardiovascular system can be modelled as a Windkessel and wave system. This concept has been extended to any arbitrary location in the cardiovascular system. We suggest that it is possible to calculate a time-varying reservoir pressure P(t) and a distance- and time-varying wave pressure p(x, t) by fitting an exponential function to the diastolic decay of the measured pressure P; defining that the measured pressure P(x, t) = P(t)+p(x, t). Velocity waveforms U can also be separated into its reservoir, U , and wave, u,components as U(x, t) = U (x, t) + u(x, t).In this study we explore the implications of applying are servoir-wave separation and wave intensity analysis techniques to understand the haemodynamics of in-vivo, noninvasive measurements of P and U in the carotid arteries of normal human subjects. Wave intensity analysis reveals a particular wave pattern where reflections can be estimated easily, but foremost, it shows that reflections are a lot smaller than previously thought.We suggest through the use of this model that the heart is the main wave generator of the cardiovascular system. The arterial system instead of impeding the flow, it stores it and distributes it throughout the arteries towards the tissue during diastole. There are some wave reflections, mainly during systole,that contribute to the changes in the pressure and velocity waveforms, however, they are small and are more evident as the measurements get further away from the ascending aorta.The application of wave intensity analysis to non-invasively measured data can provide a good insight on the physiology and the local and global properties of the cardiovascular system in health and disease in the clinical setting. This study shows preliminary results and the potential of the technique for analysing non-invasive measures, and could be particularly useful to understand and quantify the effects of therapeutic drugs in the cardiovascular system.},

   abstract = {Pulse wave velocity is related to arterial stiffness. Pulse wave velocity changes with age and disease and is a useful indicator of cardiovascular disease. Different methods are used for evaluating pulse wave velocity in systemic vessels, but none is applicable to coronary arteries. In this study we first compare values of wave speed (c) calculated from measurements of pressure (P) and velocity (U) using different analytical methods: PU-loop, beta stiffness parameter, characteristic impedance, foot-to-foot method, and the sum of squares (Sigma(2)), a novel way of calculating the wave speed (calculated from the square root of the sum of the ratio of the dP(2) and dU(2) over a complete cardiac cycle). Results from human measurements using Doppler ultrasound on carotid arteries show good correlation between the PU-loop method, beta stiffness parameter and Sigma(2). Characteristic impedance calculations show the greatest variation of all methods. The Sigma(2) method was further assessed in vitro for use in coronary vessels. Pressure and velocity measurements were obtained from human coronary arteries following angiographic studies. The measurements were made invasively by co-locating two wires with pressure and velocity transducers. Pressure and velocity data in the left anterior descending, circumflex, left main stem and right coronary arteries were acquired simultaneously along with the ECG signal. Wave speed was calculated using Sigma(2). Wave intensity analysis was used to determine forward and backward traveling waves at different times in different locations, for which wave speed, approximate distance and timings between waves need to be known.},

   abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to examine the dose-response associations of device-measured physical activity types and postures (sitting and standing time) with cardiometabolic health. METHODS: We conducted an individual participant harmonised meta-analysis of 12,095 adults (mean +/- SD age 54.5+/-9.6 years; female participants 54.8%) from six cohorts with thigh-worn accelerometry data from the Prospective Physical Activity, Sitting and Sleep (ProPASS) Consortium. Associations of daily walking, stair climbing, running, standing and sitting time with a composite cardiometabolic health score (based on standardised z scores) and individual cardiometabolic markers (BMI, waist circumference, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, HbA(1c) and total cholesterol) were examined cross-sectionally using generalised linear modelling and cubic splines. RESULTS: We observed more favourable composite cardiometabolic health (i.e. z score <0) with approximately 64 min/day walking (z score [95% CI] -0.14 [-0.25, -0.02]) and 5 min/day stair climbing (-0.14 [-0.24, -0.03]). We observed an equivalent magnitude of association at 2.6 h/day standing. Any amount of running was associated with better composite cardiometabolic health. We did not observe an upper limit to the magnitude of the dose-response associations for any activity type or standing. There was an inverse dose-response association between sitting time and composite cardiometabolic health that became markedly less favourable when daily durations exceeded 12.1 h/day. Associations for sitting time were no longer significant after excluding participants with prevalent CVD or medication use. The dose-response pattern was generally consistent between activity and posture types and individual cardiometabolic health markers. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In this first activity type-specific analysis of device-based physical activity, ~64 min/day of walking and ~5.0 min/day of stair climbing were associated with a favourable cardiometabolic risk profile. The deleterious associations of sitting time were fully attenuated after exclusion of participants with prevalent CVD and medication use. Our findings on cardiometabolic health and durations of different activities of daily living and posture may guide future interventions involving lifestyle modification.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Arterial hemodynamic parameters derived from reservoir-excess pressure analysis exhibit prognostic utility. Reservoir-excess pressure analysis may provide useful information about an influence of altered hemodynamics on target organ such as the kidneys. We determined whether the parameters derived from the reservoir-excess pressure analysis were associated with the reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate in 542 older adults (69.4+/-7.9 years, 194 females) at baseline and after 3 years. METHODS: Reservoir-excess pressure parameters, including reservoir pressure integral, excess pressure integral, systolic, and diastolic rate constants, were obtained by radial artery tonometry. RESULTS: After 3 years, and in a group of 94 individuals (72.4+/-7.6 years, 26 females), there was an estimated glomerular filtration rate reduction of >5% per year (median reduction of 20.5% over 3 years). A multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that higher baseline reservoir pressure integral was independently associated with a smaller reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate after accounting for conventional cardiovascular risk factors and study centers (odds ratio: 0.660 [95% CIs, 0.494-0.883]; P=0.005). The association remained unchanged after further adjustments for potential confounders and baseline renal function (odds ratio: 0.528 [95% CIs, 0.351-0.794]; P=0.002). No other reservoir-excess pressure parameters exhibited associations with the reduction in renal function. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that baseline reservoir pressure integral was associated with the decline in renal function in older adults at 3-year follow-up, independently of conventional cardiovascular risk factors. This suggests that reservoir pressure integral may play a role in the functional decline of the kidneys.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Hypertension is a recognized risk factor for the development of cognitive impairment and dementia in older adults. Aortic stiffness and altered haemodynamics could promote the transmission of detrimental high pressure pulsatility into the cerebral circulation, potentially damaging brain microvasculature and leading to cognitive impairment. We determined whether reservoir-excess pressure parameters were associated with cognitive function in people with hypertension (HT) and normotension (NT). METHODS: We studied 35 middle-aged and older treatment-naive stage II/III HT (office systolic BP 176 +/- 17 mmHg) and 35 age-, sex- and body mass index-matched NT (office systolic BP 127 +/- 8 mmHg). Parameters derived from reservoir-excess pressure analysis including reservoir pressure integral (INTPR), excess pressure integral (INTXSP), systolic rate constant (SRC), diastolic rate constant (DRC) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were calculated from an ensemble-averaged aortic pressure waveform derived from radial artery tonometry. Cognitive function was assessed using the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R), Trail Making Test Part A (TMT-A) and Part B (TMT-B). RESULTS: All reservoir-excess pressure parameters were greater in HT than NT (all P < 0.05). Greater INTXSP was associated with lower ACE-R score ( rs = -0.31), longer TMT-A ( r = 0.31) and TMT-B ( r = 0.38). Likewise, greater DRC and PWV were also associated with lower ACE-R score ( rs = -0.27 and rs = -0.33), longer TMT-A ( r = 0.51 and r = 0.40) and TMT-B ( r = 0.38 and r = 0.32). Greater INTXSP, DRC and PWV are consistently associated with worse cognitive function in this study. CONCLUSIONS: These observations support a potential mechanistic link between adverse haemodynamics and a heightened risk of cognitive impairment in older adults with hypertension.},

   abstract = {Background: People of South Asian and African Caribbean ethnicities living in UK have a high risk of cardiometabolic disease. Limited data exist regarding detailed cardiometabolic phenotyping in this population. Methods enabling this are widely available, but the practical aspects of undertaking such studies in large and diverse samples are seldom reported. Methods: The Southall and Brent Revisited (SABRE) study is the UK's largest tri-ethnic longitudinal cohort. Over 1,400 surviving participants (58-85 years) attended the 2nd study visit (2008-2011); during which, comprehensive cardiovascular phenotyping, including 3D-echocardiography [3D-speckle-tracking (3D-STE)], computed tomography, coronary artery calcium scoring, pulse wave velocity, central blood pressure, carotid artery ultrasound, and retinal imaging, were performed. We describe the methods used with the aim of providing a guide to their feasibility and reproducibility in a large tri-ethnic population-based study of older people. Results: Conventional echocardiography and all vascular measurements showed high feasibility (>90% analyzable of clinic attendees), but 3D-echocardiography (3DE) and 3D-STE were less feasible (76% 3DE acquisition feasibility and 38% 3D-STE feasibility of clinic attendees). 3D-STE feasibility differed by ethnicity, being lowest in South Asian participants and highest in African Caribbean participants (p < 0.0001). Similar trends were observed in men (P < 0.0001) and women (P = 0.005); however, in South Asians, there were more women with unreadable 3D-images compared to men (67 vs. 58%). Intra- and inter-observer variabilities were excellent for most of conventional and advanced echocardiographic measures. The test-retest reproducibility was good-excellent and fair-good for conventional and advanced echocardiographic measures, respectively, but lower than when re-reading the same images. All vascular measures demonstrated excellent or fair-good reproducibility. Conclusions: We describe the feasibility and reproducibility of detailed cardiovascular phenotyping in an ethnically diverse population. The data collected will lead to a better understanding of why people of South Asian and African Caribbean ancestry are at elevated risk of cardiometabolic diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Excess adiposity is associated with poorer cardiac function and adverse left ventricular (LV) remodelling. However, its importance over the adult life course on future cardiac structure and systolic and diastolic function is unknown. METHODS: A total of 1690 participants in the National Survey of Health and Development birth cohort underwent repeated adiposity [body mass index (BMI)/waist-to-hip ratio (WHR)] measurements over adulthood and investigation, including echocardiography at age 60-64 years. The relationship between LV structure [LV mass (LVM), relative wall thickness, and LV internal diameter in diastole (LVIDd)] and function (diastolic: E/e', e', and left atrial volume indexed to body surface area; systolic: ejection fraction, S', and myocardial contraction fraction) was investigated using multivariable linear regression models. RESULTS: Increased BMI from age 20 years onwards was associated with greater LVM and LVIDd independent of confounders. Associations remained independent of current BMI for LVIDd and at age 26, 43, and 53 years for LVM. Increased BMI from 43 years onwards was associated with greater relative wall thickness, but not when BMI at age 60-64 years was accounted for. Increased BMI at age 26, 36, and 53 years and at 20 years onwards was associated with lower ejection fraction and myocardial contraction fraction, respectively, but not independently of BMI at 60-64 years. Higher BMI from 20 years onwards was associated with poorer diastolic function independent of confounders. Associations between BMI and left atrial volume indexed to body surface area persisted from 26 years onwards after adjustment for BMI at 60-64 years. Similar relationships were observed for WHR from age 43 years onwards. CONCLUSIONS: Higher adiposity (BMI/WHR) over adulthood is associated with evidence of adverse cardiac structure and function. Some of these associations are independent of adiposity in later life.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Heart failure (HF) with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF) shares similar diagnostic criteria to HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Whether left atrial (LA) function differs between HFmrEF and HFpEF is unknown. We, therefore, used 2D-speckle-tracking echocardiography (2D-STE) to assess LA phasic function in patients with HFpEF and HFmrEF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive outpatients diagnosed with HF according to current European recommendations were prospectively enrolled. There were 110 HFpEF and 61 HFmrEF patients with sinus rhythm, and 37 controls matched by age. LA phasic function was analysed using 2D-STE. Peak-atrial longitudinal strain (PALS), peak-atrial contraction strain (PACS), and PALS-PACS were measured reflecting LA reservoir, pump, and conduit function, respectively. Among HF groups, most of left ventricular (LV) diastolic function measures, and LA volume were similar. Both HF groups had abnormal LA phasic function compared with controls. HFmrEF patients had worse LA phasic function than HFpEF patients even among patients with LA enlargement. Among patients with normal LA size, LA reservoir, and pump function remained worse in HFmrEF. Differences in LA phasic function between HF groups remained significant after adjustment for confounders. Global PALS and PACS were inversely correlated with brain natriuretic peptide, LA volume, E/A, E/e', pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and diastolic dysfunction grade in both HF groups. CONCLUSION: LA phasic function was worse in HFmrEF patients compared with those with HFpEF regardless of LA size, and independent of potential confounders. These differences could be attributed to intrinsic LA myocardial dysfunction perhaps in relation to altered LV function.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Left ventricular (LV) mechanics by speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) is prognostic in patients with cardiovascular diseases, but evidence related to community-dwelling individuals is uncertain. We therefore performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of STE as a predictor of adverse outcomes in the general population. METHODS: PRISMA guidelines were followed and MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched to identify eligible studies. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality and secondary outcomes were composite cardiac and cardiovascular end-point. Random effects meta-analysis was performed, and a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Assessment Scale was used for quality assessment. RESULTS: Eight papers matched the predefined criteria (total number of individuals studied=11,744). All publications assessed global longitudinal strain (GLS) by two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (2D-STE), one assessed circumferential, radial and transverse strains, and one assessed GLS-derived post-systolic shortening. None assessed LV rotational measures in association with outcomes. Two studies reported associations between GLS and all-cause mortality and composite cardiovascular end-point. Six papers reported an association between GLS and composite cardiac end-point, three of which were from the same study. Four papers were suitable for meta-analysis. GLS predicted all-cause mortality (pooled minimally adjusted HR per unit strain (%)=1.07 [95% CI 1.03-1.11], p=0.001), and composite cardiovascular (pooled maximally adjusted HR=1.18 [1.09-1.28], p<0.0001) and cardiac (HR=1.08 [1.02-1.14], p=0.006) end-points. GLS also predicted coronary heart disease (HR=1.15 [1.03-1.29], p=0.017) and heart failure (HR=1.07 [1.02-1.13], p=0.012). The quality of all studies was good. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides some evidence that STE may have utility as a measure of cardiac function and risk in the general population. 2D-STE-based GLS predicts total mortality, major adverse cardiac and cardiovascular end-points in community-dwelling individuals in a limited number of studies. Despite this, this systematic review also highlights important knowledge gaps in the current literature and further evidence is needed regarding the prognostic value of LV mechanics in unselected older populations.Registration number: CRD42018090302.},

   abstract = {Background: 3D speckle-tracking echocardiography (3D-STE) is a novel method to quantify left ventricular (LV) mechanical dyssynchrony. 3D-STE is influenced by image quality, but studies on the magnitude of its effect on 3D-STE derived LV systolic dyssynchrony indices (SDIs) and their test-retest reproducibility are limited. Methods: 3D-STE was performed in two groups, each comprising 18 healthy volunteers with good echocardiographic windows. In study 1, optimal and inferior-quality images, by intentionally poor echocardiographic technique, were acquired. In study 2, sub-optimal quality images were acquired by impairing ultrasound propagation using neoprene rubber sheets (thickness 2, 3, and 4 mm) mimicking mildly, moderately, and severely impaired images, respectively. Measures (normalized to cardiac cycle duration) were volume- and strain-based SDIs defined as the standard deviation of time to minimum segmental values, and volume- and strain-derived dispersion indices. For both studies test-retest reproducibility was assessed. Results: Test-retest reproducibility was better for most indices when restricting the analysis to good quality images; nevertheless, only volume-, circumferential strain-, and principal tangential strain-derived LV dyssynchrony indices achieved fair to good reliability. There was no evidence of systematic bias due to sub-optimal quality image. Volume-, circumferential strain-, and principal tangential strain-derived SDIs correlated closely. Radial strain- and longitudinal strain-SDI correlated moderately or weakly with volume-SDI, respectively. Conclusions: Sub-optimal image quality compromised the reliability of 3D-STE derived dyssynchrony indices but did not introduce systematic bias in healthy individuals. Even with optimal quality images, only 3D-STE indices based on volume, circumferential strain and principal tangential strain showed acceptable test-retest reliability.},

   abstract = {3D-speckle tracking echocardiography(3D-STE) allows simultaneous assessment of ejection fraction(EF) and multidirectional strains, but its prognostic utility in the general population is unknown. We investigated if 3D-STE strains predicted a composite of major cardiac endpoints(MACE) beyond cardiovascular risk factors(CVDRF), and whether they were superior to 3D-EF. 529 participants in SABRE, a UK-based tri-ethnic general population cohort (69+/-6y; 76.6% male) with acceptable 3D-STE imaging were studied. Associations between 3D-EF or multidirectional myocardial strains and MACE(coronary heart disease(fatal/non-fatal), heart failure hospitalization, new-onset arrhythmia and cardiovascular mortality) were determined using Cox regression including adjustment for CVDRF and 2D-EF. Whether 3D-EF, global longitudinal strain(3D-GLS) and principle tangential strain(3D-PTS/3D-strain) improved cardiovascular risk stratification over CVDRF was investigated using a likelihood ratio test on a series of nested Cox proportional hazards models and Harrell's C statistics. During follow-up(median, 12y), there were 92 events. 3D-EF, 3D-GLS and 3D-PTS and 3D-RS were associated with MACE in unadjusted and models adjusted for CVDRF but not CVDRF+2D-EF. Compared to 3D-EF, both 3D-GLS and 3D-PTS slightly improved the predictive value over CVDRF for MACE, but the improvement was modest(C statistic increased from 0.698(0.647, 0.749) to 0.715(0.663, 0.766) comparing CVDRF with CVDRF +3D-GLS). 3D-STE-derived LV myocardial strains predicted MACE in a multi-ethnic general population sample of elderly individuals from the UK; however the added prognostic value of 3D-STE myocardial strains was small.},

   abstract = {Background Image-quality (IQ) compromises left ventricle assessment by 3-dimensional echocardiography (3DE). Sicker/frailer patients often have suboptimal IQ, and therefore observed associations may be biased by IQ. We investigated its effect in an observational study of older people and when IQ was modified experimentally in healthy volunteers. Methods and Results 3DE feasibility by IQ was assessed in 1294 individuals who attended the second wave of the Southall and Brent Revisited study and was compared with 2-dimensional (2D)-echocardiography feasibility in 147 individuals. Upon successful analysis, means of ejection fraction (3D-EF) and global longitudinal strain (3D-GLS) (plus 2D-EF) were compared in individuals with poor versus good IQ. In 2 studies of healthy participants, 3DE-IQ was impaired by (1) intentionally poor echocardiographic technique, and (2) use of a sheet of ultrasound-attenuating material (neoprene rubber; 2-4 mm). The feasibility was 41% (529/1294) for 3DE versus 61% (89/147) for 2D-EF, P<0.0001. Among acceptable images (n=529), good IQ by the 2015 American Society of Echocardiography/European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging criteria was 33.6% (178/529) and 71.3% (377/529) for 3D-EF and 3D-GLS, respectively. Individuals with poor IQ had lower 3D-EF and 3D-GLS (absolute) than those with good IQ (3D-EF: 52.8+/-6.0% versus 55.7+/-5.7%, Mean-Delta -2.9 [-3.9, 1.8]; 3D-GLS: 18.6+/-3.2% versus 19.2+/-2.9%, Mean-Delta -0.6 [-1.1, 0.0]). In 2 experimental models of poor IQ (n=36 for both), mean differences were (-2.6 to -3.2) for 3D-EF and (-1.2 to -2.0) for 3D-GLS. Similar findings were found for other 3DE left ventricle volumes and strain parameters. Conclusions 3DE parameters have low feasibility and values are systematically lower in individuals with poor IQ. Although 3D-EF and 3D-GLS have potential advantages over conventional echocardiography, further technical improvements are required to improve the utility of 3DE in clinical practice.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: To assess the feasibility of biventricular SAPPHIRE T(1) mapping in vivo across field strengths using diastolic, systolic and dark-blood (DB) approaches. METHODS: 10 healthy volunteers underwent same-day non-contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance at 1.5 Tesla (T) and 3 T. Left and right ventricular (LV, RV) T(1) mapping was performed in the basal, mid and apical short axis using 4-variants of SAPPHIRE: diastolic, systolic, 0th and 2nd order motion-sensitized DB and conventional modified Look-Locker inversion recovery (MOLLI). RESULTS: LV global myocardial T(1) times (1.5 T then 3 T results) were significantly longer by diastolic SAPPHIRE (1283 +/- 11|1600 +/- 17 ms) than any of the other SAPPHIRE variants: systolic (1239 +/- 9|1595 +/- 13 ms), 0th order DB (1241 +/- 10|1596 +/- 12) and 2nd order DB (1251 +/- 11|1560 +/- 20 ms, all p < 0.05). In the mid septum MOLLI and diastolic SAPPHIRE exhibited significant T(1) signal contamination (longer T(1)) at the blood-myocardial interface not seen with the other 3 SAPPHIRE variants (all p < 0.025). Additionally, systolic, 0th order and 2nd order DB SAPPHIRE showed narrower dispersion of myocardial T(1) times across the mid septum when compared to diastolic SAPPHIRE (interquartile ranges respectively: 25 ms, 71 ms, 73 ms vs 143 ms, all p < 0.05). RV T(1) mapping was achievable using systolic, 0th and 2nd order DB SAPPHIRE but not with MOLLI or diastolic SAPPHIRE. All 4 SAPPHIRE variants showed excellent re-read reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficients 0.953 to 0.996). CONCLUSION: These small-scale preliminary healthy volunteer data suggest that DB SAPPHIRE has the potential to reduce partial volume effects at the blood-myocardial interface, and that systolic SAPPHIRE could be a feasible solution for right ventricular T(1) mapping. Further work is needed to understand the robustness of these sequences and their potential clinical utility.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cognitive function has an important role in determining the quality of life of older adults. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is common in older people and may compromise cognitive performance; however, the extent to which this is related to carotid atherosclerosis is unclear. AIM: We investigated associations between carotid atherosclerosis and cognitive function and neuroimaging markers of brain health in a UK multi-ethnic community-based sample including older people of European, South Asian, and African-Caribbean ethnicity. METHODS: Carotid plaques and intima-media thickness (cIMT) were assessed using ultrasound in 985 people (mean age 73.2y, 56 % male). Associations of carotid atherosclerosis with cognitive function (memory, executive function, language and CSI-D, a global measure of cognitive state) and neuroimaging measures (total brain volume, hippocampal volume, white matter (WM) lesion volume and coalescence score) were analysed using regression analyses, with and without adjustment for potential confounders using two models: 1) adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity; 2) model 1 plus education, physical activity category, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, total and high density lipoprotein cholesterol, atrial fibrillation, smoking, previous CVD, alcohol consumption, and presence of chronic kidney disease. RESULTS: People with carotid plaque or higher cIMT had lower CSI-D score, poorer memory poorer executive function and higher WM lesion volume and coalescence. Language was poorer in people with plaque but was not correlated with cIMT. Associations with plaque were preserved after full adjustment (model 2) but relationships for cIMT were attenuated. Associations with other plaque characteristics were generally unconvincing after adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: This multi-ethnic cohort study provides evidence that presence of carotid plaque, is associated with poorer cognitive function and brain health.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine associations between carotid atherosclerosis assessed by ultrasound and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), a measure of global cognitive function. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched up to 1 May 2020 to identify studies assessed the associations between asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis and the MMSE. Studies reporting OR for associations between carotid plaque or intima-media thickness (cIMT) and dichotomised MMSE were meta-analysed. Publication bias of included studies was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 31 of 378 reviewed articles met the inclusion criteria; together they included 27 738 participants (age 35-95 years). Fifteen studies reported some evidence of a positive association between measures of atherosclerosis and poorer cognitive performance in either cross-sectional or longitudinal studies. The remaining 16 studies found no evidence of an association. Seven cross-sectional studies provided data suitable for meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of three studies that assessed carotid plaque (n=3549) showed an association between the presence of plaque and impaired MMSE with pooled estimate for the OR (95% CI) being 2.72 (0.85 to 4.59). An association between cIMT and impaired MMSE was reported in six studies (n=4443) with a pooled estimate for the OR (95% CI) being 1.13 (1.04 to 1.22). Heterogeneity across studies was moderate to small (carotid plaque with MMSE, I(2)=40.9%; cIMT with MMSE, I(2)=4.9%). There was evidence of publication bias for carotid plaque studies (p=0.02), but not cIMT studies (p=0.2). CONCLUSIONS: There is some, limited cross-sectional evidence indicating an association between cIMT and poorer global cognitive function assessed with MMSE. Estimates of the association between plaques and poor cognition are too imprecise to draw firm conclusions and evidence from studies of longitudinal associations between carotid atherosclerosis and MMSE is limited.

   abstract = {Several systemic factors have been shown to contribute to the acceleration of large vessel atheroma. Correction of these factors leads to a reduction in the progression of plaque formation and associated arterial wall thickness. Atheroma remains, however, a focal disease, developing at characteristic sites within the arterial tree. These sites are typically at areas of vessel branching or marked curvature, and correspond to regions of high tensile stress and low sheer stress, leading to the hypothesis that local haemodynamic factors and vessel wall mechanics potentiate the focal development of atheroma. Current assessment of vascular haemodynamics suffers from an inability to handle complex flow, and does not allow accurate determination of locally varying flow, and shear stress patterns. The application of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) flow simulation techniques to ultrasound and local pressure data, however, allows a comprehensive, non-invasive appraisal of haemodynamic flow parameters to be performed. The Candesartan cilexetil and Atenolol Carotid Haemodynamic Endpoint Trial (CACHET) study compares the effects of two antihypertensive regimens, one b-blocker-based, the other angiotensin receptor blocker based, on carotid intima-media thickness. The collection of ultrasound and pressure data on each subject provides a unique opportunity to apply these data to the CFD model to study the effects of these antihypertensive regimens on local fluid dynamics. This will lead to a greater understanding of the relationship of these factors to atheroma formation and regression.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)-based treatment reduces cardiovascular events and stroke more than does beta-blocker-based treatment despite similar blood pressure (BP) reduction. We investigated whether these treatments have different effects on cardiac and large-artery remodelling and evaluated the relation of arterial remodelling to hemodynamic changes in subjects with hypertension. METHODS: We compared the treatment effects of an ARB (candesartan cilexetil)-based regimen and a beta-blocker (atenolol)-based regimen for 52 weeks on common carotid artery (CCA) and left ventricular structure in hypertensive patients in a randomized, double-blind study. Clinic brachial BP and 24-hour ambulatory BP, carotid BP, left ventricular mass index, CCA intima-media thickness, lumen diameter, intima-media area, and carotid blood flow were measured. Distensibility, circumferential tensile stress, Young's elastic modulus (E(m)), and shear stress (tau) in the CCA were also calculated. RESULTS: Both candesartan and atenolol reduced intima-media thickness and intima-media area and increased distensibility to similar extents after 52 weeks of treatment. Despite similar reductions in BP, treatment with atenolol resulted in a lesser reduction in left ventricular mass index, a decrease in lumen diameter, and a reduction in carotid blood flow compared with candesartan. CONCLUSIONS: BP-independent effects of ARB on cardiac and arterial structure may contribute to the beneficial effects of these agents on cardiovascular disease.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess whether using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging combined with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) could reveal changes in common carotid artery (CCA) flow and wall shear stress (WSS) that might contribute to differences in CCA remodeling between amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, and lisinopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, despite similar reductions in blood pressure (BP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained, and participants gave informed consent. Nine subjects with hypertension were recruited into a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized three-way crossover study to compare the hemodynamic effects of 7 days of treatment with placebo, amlodipine, or lisinopril. After each treatment period, patients underwent CCA ultrasonography, BP measurement, and MR imaging with CFD. Analyses were performed by using repeated-measures analysis of variance, followed by the Tukey test or the Wilcoxon matched-pairs test. RESULTS: Amlodipine and lisinopril lowered BP similarly, but CCA flow rate was significantly higher (P < .01) and distal vascular resistance was lower (P = .016) after amlodipine treatment than after lisinopril treatment. WSS on the inner wall of the CCA was significantly lower after lisinopril treatment than after amlodipine treatment (P = .03). The change in WSS in the CCA correlated with the change in vascular resistance (r = -0.85, P < .001). CONCLUSION: Amlodipine causes increased blood flow and increased time-averaged WSS in the CCA compared with lisinopril, despite similar reductions in BP. Differences in the subacute hemodynamic effects of amlodipine and lisinopril could contribute to the differences in CCA remodeling seen in long-term studies.

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Derivation of blood flow velocity from a blood pressure waveform is a novel technique, which could have potential clinical importance. Excess pressure, calculated from the blood pressure waveform via the reservoir-excess pressure model, is purported to be an analogue of blood flow velocity but this has never been examined in detail, which was the aim of this study. METHODS: Intra-arterial blood pressure was measured sequentially at the brachial and radial arteries via fluid-filled catheter simultaneously with blood flow velocity waveforms recorded via Doppler ultrasound on the contralateral arm (n = 98, aged 61 +/- 10 years, 72% men). Excess pressure was derived from intra-arterial blood pressure waveforms using pressure-only reservoir-excess pressure analysis. RESULTS: Brachial and radial blood flow velocity waveform morphology were closely approximated by excess pressure derived from their respective sites of measurement (median cross-correlation coefficient r = 0.96 and r = 0.95 for brachial and radial comparisons, respectively). In frequency analyses, coherence between blood flow velocity and excess pressure was similar for brachial and radial artery comparisons (brachial and radial median coherence = 0.93 and 0.92, respectively). Brachial and radial blood flow velocity pulse heights were correlated with their respective excess pressure pulse heights (r = 0.53, P < 0.001 and r = 0.43, P < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Excess pressure is an analogue of blood flow velocity, thus affording the opportunity to derive potentially important information related to arterial blood flow using only the blood pressure waveform.},

   abstract = {There is a growing body of evidence indicating that reservoir-excess pressure model parameters provide physiological and clinical insights above and beyond standard blood pressure (BP) and pulse waveform analysis. This information has never been collectively examined and was the aim of this review. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality worldwide, with BP as the greatest cardiovascular disease risk factor. However, brachial systolic and diastolic BP provide limited information on the underlying BP waveform, missing important BP-related cardiovascular risk. A comprehensive analysis of the BP waveform is provided by parameters derived via the reservoir-excess pressure model, which include reservoir pressure, excess pressure, and systolic and diastolic rate constants and Pinfinity. These parameters, derived from the arterial BP waveform, provide information on the underlying arterial physiology and ventricular-arterial interactions otherwise missed by conventional BP and waveform indices. Application of the reservoir-excess pressure model in the clinical setting may facilitate a better understanding and earlier identification of cardiovascular dysfunction associated with disease. Indeed, reservoir-excess pressure parameters have been associated with sub-clinical markers of end-organ damage, cardiac and vascular dysfunction, and future cardiovascular events and mortality beyond conventional risk factors. In the future, greater understanding is needed on how the underlying physiology of the reservoir-excess pressure parameters informs cardiovascular disease risk prediction over conventional BP and waveform indices. Additional consideration should be given to the application of the reservoir-excess pressure model in clinical practice using new technologies embedded into conventional BP assessment methods.},

This study used numerical methods to more accurately determine WSS in the carotid artery and to investigate possible determinants of increased IMT. METHODS: IMT [common carotid artery (CCA) and bulb], CCA flow velocity, brachial systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and carotid systolic pressure (cSBP) were measured in 14 healthy subjects (aged 44 +/- 16 yr). Flow patterns in the carotid bifurcation were determined by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on three-dimensional ultrasound geometry. Instantaneous and time-averaged wall shear stress (WSS(av)), oscillatory shear index (OSI), and wall shear stress angle gradients (WSSAG) were calculated. RESULTS: IMT was positively related to SBP, DBP, cSBP, and WSSAG and inversely related to WSS(av) in the CCA. In the bulb, IMT was positively related to SBP and cSBP but was not significantly related to WSS(av) or WSSAG. IMT was unrelated to OSI in both the CCA and the bulb. CONCLUSION: Increased carotid artery IMT in healthy subjects with no evidence of focal plaques is primarily a response to elevated pressure.},

   abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) flow simulation techniques have the potential to enhance understanding of how haemodynamic factors are involved in atherosclerosis. Recently, three-dimensional ultrasound has emerged as an alternative to other three-dimensional imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). The method can be used to generate accurate vascular geometry suitable for CFD simulations and can be coupled with Doppler ultrasound to provide physiologically realistic flow boundary conditions. However, there are various ways to utilize the flow data acquired, possibly leading to different results regarding both flow and wall shear stress patterns. A disadvantage of three-dimensional ultrasound for imaging the carotid bifurcation has been established as being the scanning limitation of the jawbone position. This may make artificial extensions of the internal and/or external carotid arteries necessary, which in turn may influence the predicted flow patterns. Flow simulations were carried out for three outflow calculation schemes as well as four geometries with different extensions to the carotid daughter vessels. It was found that variation of flow patterns was more strongly influenced by the outflow conditions than by the extensions of the daughter vessels. Consequently, it is recommended that for future CFD simulations of carotid flow using three-dimensional ultrasound data, the outflow boundary conditions should rely on the most accurate measurement available, and flow data recorded in the common and internal carotid are considered more reliable than data from the external carotid. Even though the extended lengths of the daughter vessels have insignificant effects on the predicted haemodynamic parameters, it would be a safer option to extend the internal carotid by approximately three times the diameter of the common carotid artery.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Wave reflection may be an important influence on blood pressure, but the extent to which reflections undergo attenuation during retrograde propagation has not been studied. We quantified retrograde transmission of a reflected wave created by occlusion of the left femoral artery in man. METHODS: 20 subjects (age 31-83 years; 14 male) underwent invasive measurement of pressure and flow velocity with a sensor-tipped intra-arterial wire at multiple locations distal to the proximal aorta before, during and following occlusion of the left femoral artery by thigh cuff inflation. A numerical model of the circulation was also used to predict reflected wave transmission. Wave reflection was measured as the ratio of backward to forward wave energy (WRI) and the ratio of peak backward to forward pressure (Pb/Pf). RESULTS: Cuff inflation caused a marked reflection which was largest at 5-10 cm from the cuff (change (Delta) in WRI=0.50 (95% CI 0.38, 0.62); p<0.001, DeltaPb/Pf=0.23 (0.18-0.29); p<0.001). The magnitude of the cuff-induced reflection decreased progressively at more proximal locations and was barely discernible at sites>40 cm from the cuff including in the proximal aorta. Numerical modelling gave similar predictions to those observed experimentally. CONCLUSIONS: Reflections due to femoral artery occlusion are markedly attenuated by the time they reach the proximal aorta. This is due to impedance mismatches of bifurcations traversed in the backward direction. This degree of attenuation is inconsistent with the idea of a large discrete reflected wave arising from the lower limb and propagating back into the aorta.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We undertook a meta-analysis to determine whether changes in wave reflection substantiate the consensus explanation of why blood pressure (BP) changes with aging. BACKGROUND: Consensus documents attribute the aging changes in BP to wave reflection moving progressively from diastole into systole. However, the extensive quantitative data on this phenomenon have never been systematically reviewed. Individual studies have been small, and limited to a narrow age range. METHODS: Using PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases, we identified 64 studies (including 13,770 subjects, age range 4 to 91 years) reporting the timing of wave reflection, defined as the time from the onset (foot) of the pressure waveform to the shoulder point (anachrotic notch). RESULTS: In subjects of all ages, reflection times were well within systole. There was a small tendency for younger subjects to have later reflection, but this was only 0.7 ms per year, whereas the weighted mean reflection time was 136 ms (99% confidence interval: 130 to 141 ms) and the mean duration of systole was 328 ms (99% confidence interval: 310 to 347 ms). At this rate of change with age, arrival of wave reflection would only be construed to be in diastole at an extrapolated age of -221 years. CONCLUSIONS: These findings challenge the current consensus view that a shift in timing of wave reflection significantly contributes to the changes in the BP waveform with aging. We should re-evaluate the mechanisms of BP elevation in aging.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have far-reaching consequences on population health. We investigated whether these consequences included changes in health-impacting behaviours which are important drivers of health inequalities. METHODS: Using data from five representative British cohorts (born 2000-2002, 1989-1990, 1970, 1958 and 1946), we investigated sleep, physical activity (exercise), diet and alcohol intake (N=14 297). We investigated change in each behaviour (pre/during the May 2020 lockdown), and differences by age/cohort, gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic position (childhood social class, education attainment and adult financial difficulties). Logistic regression models were used, accounting for study design and non-response weights, and meta-analysis used to pool and test cohort differences in association. RESULTS: Change occurred in both directions-shifts from the middle part of the distribution to both declines and increases in sleep, exercise and alcohol use. Older cohorts were less likely to report changes in behaviours while the youngest reported more frequent increases in sleep, exercise, and fruit and vegetable intake, yet lower alcohol consumption. Widening inequalities in sleep during lockdown were more frequent among women, socioeconomically disadvantaged groups and ethnic minorities. For other outcomes, inequalities were largely unchanged, yet ethnic minorities were at higher risk of undertaking less exercise and consuming lower amounts of fruit and vegetables. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide new evidence on the multiple changes to behavioural outcomes linked to lockdown, and the differential impacts across generation, gender, socioeconomic circumstances across life, and ethnicity. Lockdown appeared to widen some (but not all) forms of health inequality.},

   abstract = {Socioeconomic inequalities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) persist in high-income countries despite marked overall declines in CVD-related morbidity and mortality. After decades of research, the field has struggled to unequivocally answer a crucial question: is the association between low socioeconomic position (SEP) and the development of CVD causal? We review relevant evidence from various study designs and disciplinary perspectives. Traditional observational, family-based and Mendelian randomization studies support the widely accepted view that low SEP causally influences CVD. However, results from quasi-experimental and experimental studies are both limited and equivocal. While more experimental and quasi-experimental studies are needed to aid causal understanding and inform policy, high-quality descriptive studies are also required to document inequalities, investigate their contextual dependence and consider SEP throughout the lifespan; no simple hierarchy of evidence exists for an exposure as complex as SEP. The COVID-19 pandemic illustrates the context-dependent nature of CVD inequalities, with the generation of potentially new causal pathways linking SEP and CVD. The linked goals of understanding the causal nature of SEP and CVD associations, their contextual dependence, and their remediation by policy interventions necessitate a detailed understanding of society, its change over time and the phenotypes of CVD. Interdisciplinary research is therefore key to advancing both causal understanding and policy translation.},

   abstract = {Three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound is a relatively new technique, which is well suited to imaging superficial blood vessels, and potentially provides a useful, noninvasive method for generating anatomically realistic 3-D models of the peripheral vasculature. Such models are essential for accurate simulation of blood flow using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but may also be used to quantify atherosclerotic plaque more comprehensively than routine clinical methods. In this paper, we present a spline-based method for reconstructing the normal and diseased carotid artery bifurcation from images acquired using a freehand 3-D ultrasound system. The vessel wall (intima-media interface) and lumen surfaces are represented by a geometric model defined using smoothing splines. Using this coupled wall-lumen model, we demonstrate how plaque may be analyzed automatically to provide a comprehensive set of quantitative measures of size and shape, including established clinical measures, such as degree of (diameter) stenosis. The geometric accuracy of 3-D ultrasound reconstruction is assessed using pulsatile phantoms of the carotid bifurcation, and we conclude by demonstrating the in vivo application of the algorithms outlined to 3-D ultrasound scans from a series of patient carotid arteries.},

The error in 3-D distance measurements, under conditions appropriate to US investigations of the carotid arteries, was found to be -0.45 +/- 1.30 mm, equivalent to -0.53 +/- 3.39% (mean +/- SD). The results are relevant to data acquired using a single sweep scan and for distances in the range 25.00 to 79.06 mm. Both the overall accuracy and precision in point-target location were found to be relatively unaffected by scan depth, and the precision of point-target location was found to be poorest in the elevational direction.

A commercial device (Ascension pcBIRD) was evaluated to assess the accuracy in locating the scan probe as part of a digital, freehand 3-D US imaging system aimed at vascular applications. The device was optimised by selecting a measurement rate and filter setting that minimised the mean deviation in repeated position and orientation measurements. Experimental evaluation of accuracy indicated that, overall, absolute errors were small: the RMS absolute error was 0.2 mm (range: -0.7 to 0.5 mm) for positional measurements over translations up to 90 mm, and 0.2 degrees (range: -0.8 to 0.9 degrees ) for rotational measurements up to 30 degrees. In the case of position measurements, the absolute errors were influenced by the location of the scanner relative to the scan volume. We conclude that the device tested provides an accuracy sufficient for use within a freehand 3-D US system for carotid artery imaging.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The test-retest reliability for multiple cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX) variables has not been compared in a single study and the influence of different diseases on test-retest reliability has not been examined. We investigated different measures of test-retest reliability for multiple variables and compared them by category of cardiac or respiratory disease. METHODS: Patients with chronic obstructive airways disease (n = 24), heart failure (n = 43), or severe mitral valve disease (n = 26) were recruited into a prospective study. Each patient underwent two bicycle ergometer tests; the first, a familiarization test, with a 10 W/min ramp, and the second a personalized ramp based on the results of the familiarization test to elicit maximal effort within 8-10 min. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and coefficients of variation between the two tests were calculated. Influence of potential modifiers was assessed using repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Peak VO2 (ICC 0.95, 95% CI 0.94-0.97), oxygen uptake efficiency slope (ICC 0.93, 95% CI 0.90-0.95), O2 pulse (ICC 0.96, 95% CI 0.94-0.97), and the VE/VCO2 ratio at the nadir (ICC 0.92, 95% CI 0.89-0.95) all showed excellent test-retest reliability, with within-subject coefficients of variation <0.12. VO2 at the anaerobic threshold (ICC 0.84, 95% CI 0.78-0.89) and the VE/VCO2 slope (ICC 0.88, 95% CI 0.79-0.93) showed good test-retest reliability, although inferior to peak VO2. Age, gender, body mass index, disease aetiology, protocol change, and intertest interval did not affect the reliability of most variables. CONCLUSIONS: CPX showed high test-retest reliability; certain variables such as peak VO2 and oxygen uptake efficiency slope outperform others. These results identify which variables are most suitable for serial testing of patients with three common disease aetiologies owing to their superior reproducibility.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The study sought to compare the relative discrimination of various cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) variables between cardiac and respiratory disease. BACKGROUND: CPX testing is used in many cardiorespiratory diseases. However, discrimination of cardiac and respiratory dysfunction can be problematic. Anaerobic threshold (AT) and oxygen-uptake to work-rate relationship (VO2/WR slope) have been proposed as diagnostic of cardiac dysfunction, but multiple variables have not been compared. METHODS: A total of 73 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n = 25), heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (n = 40), or combined COPD and HFrEF (n = 8) were recruited and underwent CPX testing on a bicycle ergometer. Following a familiarization test, each patient underwent a personalized second test aiming for maximal exercise after approximately 10 min. Measurements from this test were used to calculate area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: Peak VO2 was similar between the 2 principal groups (COPD 17.1 +/- 4.6 ml/min/kg; HFrEF 16.4 +/- 3.6 ml/min/kg). Breathing reserve (AUC: 0.91) and percent predicted oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES) (AUC: 0.87) had the greatest ability to discriminate between COPD and HFrEF. VO2/WR slope performed significantly worse (AUC: 0.68). VO2 at the AT did not discriminate (AUC for AT as percent predicted peak VO2: 0.56). OUES and breathing reserve remained strong discriminators when compared with an external cohort of healthy matched controls, and were comparable to B-type natriuretic peptide. CONCLUSIONS: Breathing reserve and OUES discriminate heart failure from COPD. Despite it being considered an important determinant of cardiac dysfunction, the AT could not discriminate these typical clinical populations while the VO2/WR slope showed poor to moderate discriminant ability.

   abstract = {Antihypertensive treatment can improve tissue Doppler indices of left ventricular diastolic function in the short term, but little is known about the longer-term effect of different antihypertensive treatments on progression of left ventricular diastolic function and left ventricular hypertrophy. We hypothesized that long-term treatment of hypertension will lead to improvements in left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic function. We collected detailed cardiovascular phenotypic data on 1006 participants from a substudy of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial. Patients randomized to either an amlodipine+/-perindopril-based or an atenolol+/-bendroflumethiazide-based regimen underwent conventional and tissue Doppler echocardiography at time of control of blood pressure after randomization ( approximately 1.5 years; phase 1) and after a further 2 years of antihypertensive treatment (phase 2). There were no prerandomization data. Five hundred thirty-six patients had complete data collection at both phases. Left ventricular mass index regressed from phase 1 to 2 with no significant difference between treatment groups (amlodipine: 119.5-116.8; atenolol: 122.9-117.5; P<0.001 for both). Conversely, tissue Doppler diastolic indices did not change in the amlodipine+/-perindopril-based regimen (E/e', 7.5-7.6 cm/s; P=not significant), but deteriorated in the atenolol+/-bendroflumethiazide-based regimen (E/e', 8.0-8.5 cm/s; P<0.01). Despite regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, there was no associated improvement in diastolic function. In fact, long-term treatment with atenolol+/-bendroflumethiazide resulted in a progressive deterioration in E/e'. This may be a factor contributing to the previously described worse clinical outcome in patients treated with atenolol+/-bendroflumethiazide compared with amlodipine+/-perindopril.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Constant flow and concentration CO2 has previously been efficacious in attenuating ventilatory oscillations in periodic breathing (PB) where oscillations in CO2 drive ventilatory oscillations. However, it has the undesirable effect of increasing end-tidal CO2, and ventilation. We tested, in a model of PB, a dynamic CO2 therapy that aims to attenuate pacemaker-induced ventilatory oscillations while minimising CO2 dose. METHODS: First, pacemakers were manipulated in 12 pacemaker recipients, 6 with heart failure (ejection fraction (EF)=23.7+/-7.3%) and 6 without heart failure, to experimentally induce PB. Second, we applied a real-time algorithm of pre-emptive dynamic exogenous CO2 administration, and tested different timings. RESULTS: We found that cardiac output alternation using pacemakers successfully induced PB. Dynamic CO2 therapy, when delivered coincident with hyperventilation, attenuated 57% of the experimentally induced oscillations in end-tidal CO2: SD/mean 0.06+/-0.01 untreated versus 0.04+/-0.01 with treatment (p<0.0001) and 0.02+/-0.01 in baseline non-modified breathing. This translated to a 56% reduction in induced ventilatory oscillations: SD/mean 0.19+/-0.09 untreated versus 0.14+/-0.06 with treatment (p=0.001) and 0.10+/-0.03 at baseline. Of note, end-tidal CO2 did not significantly rise when dynamic CO2 was applied to the model (4.84+/-0.47 vs 4.91+/- 0.45 kPa, p=0.08). Furthermore, mean ventilation was also not significantly increased by dynamic CO2 compared with untreated (7.8+/-1.2 vs 8.4+/-1.2 L/min, p=0.17). CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac pacemaker manipulation can be used to induce PB experimentally. In this induced PB, delivering CO2 coincident with hyperventilation, ventilatory oscillations can be substantially attenuated without a significant increase in end-tidal CO2 or ventilation. Dynamic CO2 administration might be developed into a clinical treatment for PB. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN29344450.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: South Asians worldwide have an elevated risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), only partly explicable by a higher prevalence of diabetes. Diabetes and dysglycaemia are associated with increased heart rates and abnormal cardiac sympathovagal balance, and are predictive of increased coronary mortality. This study investigated ethnic differences in heart rate, sympathovagal balance, and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) to establish if they were explained by dysglycaemia/insulin resistance. METHODS: 84 South Asian and 83 European men (age 45-85 yrs), half with established CHD and half without proven CHD, underwent metabolic profiling and assessment of mean RR interval, heart rate variablility (HRV) and BRS. RESULTS: Mean resting RR interval was greater in Europeans than South Asians (1014 (149) ms vs. 936 (158) ms respectively, means (SD); P = 0.005). This corresponded to resting heart rates of 59.1 bpm for Europeans and 64.1 bpm for South Asians. No ethnic differences were detected in HRV or BRS. Insulin resistance, assessed by the homeostasis model of assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), correlated with mean RR interval (beta coefficient = -0.189, P = 0.04) and BRS (beta coefficient = -0.246, P = 0.006) and similar correlations were seen with fasting serum glucose. However, ethnic differences in mean RR interval persisted after adjustment for age, systolic BP, beta blocker use, and HOMA-IR. INTERPRETATION: South Asian men have higher heart rates compared with European men. This difference was not explained by measures of insulin resistance or other risk factors. This may be indicative of altered sympathovagal balance, and contribute to the greater coronary disease risk in people of South Asian ethnicity.},

   abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: A high prevalence of diabetes contributes to excess CHD in Indian Asians, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV) and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) are measures of cardiac autonomic function that are disturbed by hyperglycaemia and predict CHD. We compared these measures in Indian Asians and Europeans, and sought explanations for the observed differences. METHODS: A representative sample of 149 Europeans and 151 Indian Asians was recruited from primary care, 66% of them men (aged 35-75 years), 34% women (aged 55-75 years). Heart rate, HRV, BRS and cardio-metabolic profiles were measured over four successive 5 min periods with continuous ECG and blood pressure monitoring. RESULTS: Indian Asians were hyperglycaemic compared with Europeans (HbA(1c) (mean +/- SD) 6.5 +/- 1.2% vs 5.9 +/- 1.0%, p = 0.001). They had shorter mean RR intervals ((mean +/- SE) 969 +/- 13 vs 1,022 +/- 12 ms, p = 0.002), lower total RR interval power ((geometric mean, 95% CI) 925 [796-1075] vs 1,224 [1,064-1,422] ms(2), p = 0.008) and lower BRS ((mean +/- SE) 5.7 +/- 1.0 vs 6.6 +/- 1.0 ms/mmHg, p = 0.01). All measures of cardiac autonomic dysfunction were significantly associated with hyperglycaemia (mean RR interval vs HbA(1c) r = -0.22; p < 0.001). Ethnic differences in cardiac autonomic function persisted after adjustment for age, blood pressure and medication (mean RR interval 973 vs 1,021 ms, p = 0.004), but were attenuated or abolished by adjusting for HbA(1c) (979 vs 1,014 ms, p = 0.06) or other markers of hyperglycaemia. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Indian Asians from the general population have impaired cardiovascular autonomic function compared with Europeans. This is due to greater hyperglycaemia in Indian Asians and may determine their increased CHD risk.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: South Asians have a 1.5-fold increased stroke mortality compared with Europeans, despite similar blood pressures (BP). We hypothesized that it is the greater hyperglycaemia in South Asians that increases stroke risk, by adversely affecting cerebrovascular haemodynamics. METHODS: A population-based sample of 149 Europeans and 151 South Asians underwent metabolic profiling and concurrent measurement of finger BP using a Finapres and middle cerebral artery (MCA) blood flow velocity using transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Cerebrovascular autoregulation, cerebrovascular resistance [resistive index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI)] were calculated. Means of cerebrovascular haemodynamic measures were compared by ethnicity, with the introduction of explanatory variables to a regression model to determine which variable could best account for ethnic differences. RESULTS: Cerebrovascular resistance (RI) was 12.9 x 10(3) (0.9-24.8, P = 0.04) greater in South Asians than Europeans. Systolic, diastolic and mean MCA velocities were also higher in South Asians (mean velocity 41.4 +/- 8.0 cm/s vs 38.0 +/- 8.0 cm/s, respectively, P = 0.001). Low frequency gain, a measure of autoregulation, was worse in South Asians compared with Europeans (0.50 +/- 0.01 cm/s mm/Hg vs 0.45 +/- 0.01 cm/s mm/Hg, P = 0.01). RI positively correlated with HbA(1c) (r = 0.184; P < 0.01). Adjustment for BP could not explain the higher RI in South Asians, but adjustment for HbA(1c) abolished the ethnic difference in RI (5.8 x 10(3) (-6.5 to 18.1, P = 0.4). CONCLUSIONS: Cerebrovascular resistance and autoregulation are worse in South Asians than in Europeans, despite equivalent resting BP. The greater hyperglycaemia in South Asians accounts for their adverse cerebrovascular resistance. This could explain excess stroke in South Asians but requires testing in longitudinal studies.},

METHODS: The study sample comprised 4240 participants from the Vitamin D Assessment (ViDA) Study (mean+/-SD age = 66 +/- 8). Arterial stiffness was assessed from 5 April 2011-6 November 2012 by way of aortic PWV (aPWV) and estimated carotid-femoral PWV (ecfPWV). Incident diabetes/prediabetes was determined by linkage to dispensed prescription and national hospital discharge registers. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the risk of diabetes/prediabetes in relation to chosen arterial stiffness measures both overall and over quartiles. RESULTS: During a mean+/-SD follow-up of 10.5 +/- 0.4 years, 470 participants developed diabetes/prediabetes. Following adjustment for potential confounders, aPWV (hazard ratio (HR) per SD increase, 1.40, 95 % CI, 1.19-1.64) was associated with the incidence of diabetes. The risk of incident diabetes was, compared to the first quartile, higher in the fourth quartile of aPWV (HR, 1.98, 95 %CI, 1.26-3.11)(P(trend)=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Arterial stiffness, as measured by aPWV may be a useful predictor of incident diabetes that can be utilized in clinical practice.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate whether arterial stiffness, assessed oscillometrically, is associated with incident glaucoma in the Vitamin D Assessment (ViDA) Study cohort, aged 50 to 84 years. DESIGN: Prospective, population-based cohort study. METHODS: Arterial stiffness was assessed in 4,713 participants without known glaucoma (mean +/- SD age = 66 +/- 8 years) from 5 April 2011 to 6 November 2012 by way of aortic PWV (aPWV), estimated carotid-femoral PWV (ePWV) and aortic PP (aPP). Incident glaucoma was identified through linkage to national prescription and hospital discharge registers. Relative risks of glaucoma for each arterial stiffness measure were estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression, over the continuum of values and by quartiles. RESULTS: During a mean +/- SD follow-up of 10.5+/-0.4 years, 301 participants developed glaucoma. Arterial stiffness, as measured by aPWV (Hazard ratio (HR) per SD increase, 1.36, 95% CI 1.14-1.62) and ePWV (HR per SD increase, 1.40, 95% CI 1.14-1.71) but not aPP (HR per SD increase, 1.06, 95% CI 0.92-1.23) was associated with incident glaucoma. When arterial stiffness was analyzed as a categorical variable, the highest quartiles of aPWV (HR, 2.62, 95% CI 1.52-4.52; P(trend) = .007), ePWV (HR, 2.42, 95%CI 1.37-4.27; P(trend) = .03), and aPP (HR, 1.68, 95%CI 1.10-2.5; P(trend) = .02) were associated with the development of glaucoma. CONCLUSIONS: Arterial stiffness measured with a simple oscillometric device predicted the development of glaucoma and could potentially be used in clinical practice to help identify people at risk of this condition. It may also present a new therapeutic research avenue, including in respect of systemic antihypertensives.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Automated analysis of cardiac structure and function using machine learning (ML) has great potential, but is currently hindered by poor generalizability. Comparison is traditionally against clinicians as a reference, ignoring inherent human inter- and intraobserver error, and ensuring that ML cannot demonstrate superiority. Measuring precision (scan:rescan reproducibility) addresses this. We compared precision of ML and humans using a multicenter, multi-disease, scan:rescan cardiovascular magnetic resonance data set. METHODS: One hundred ten patients (5 disease categories, 5 institutions, 2 scanner manufacturers, and 2 field strengths) underwent scan:rescan cardiovascular magnetic resonance (96% within one week). After identification of the most precise human technique, left ventricular chamber volumes, mass, and ejection fraction were measured by an expert, a trained junior clinician, and a fully automated convolutional neural network trained on 599 independent multicenter disease cases. Scan:rescan coefficient of variation and 1000 bootstrapped 95% CIs were calculated and compared using mixed linear effects models. RESULTS: Clinicians can be confident in detecting a 9% change in left ventricular ejection fraction, with greater than half of coefficient of variation attributable to intraobserver variation. Expert, trained junior, and automated scan:rescan precision were similar (for left ventricular ejection fraction, coefficient of variation 6.1 [5.2%-7.1%], P=0.2581; 8.3 [5.6%-10.3%], P=0.3653; 8.8 [6.1%-11.1%], P=0.8620). Automated analysis was 186x faster than humans (0.07 versus 13 minutes). CONCLUSIONS: Automated ML analysis is faster with similar precision to the most precise human techniques, even when challenged with real-world scan:rescan data. Assessment of multicenter, multi-vendor, multi-field strength scan:rescan data (available at www.thevolumesresource.com) permits a generalizable assessment of ML precision and may facilitate direct translation of ML to clinical practice.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aging increases aortic stiffness, contributing to cardiovascular risk even in healthy individuals. Aortic stiffness is reduced through supervised training programs, but these are not easily generalizable. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine whether real-world exercise training for a first-time marathon can reverse age-related aortic stiffening. METHODS: Untrained healthy individuals underwent 6 months of training for the London Marathon. Assessment pre-training and 2 weeks post-marathon included central (aortic) blood pressure and aortic stiffness using cardiovascular magnetic resonance distensibility. Biological "aortic age" was calculated from the baseline chronological age-stiffness relationship. Change in stiffness was assessed at the ascending (Ao-A) and descending aorta at the pulmonary artery bifurcation (Ao-P) and diaphragm (Ao-D). Data are mean changes (95% confidence intervals [CIs]). RESULTS: A total of 138 first-time marathon completers (age 21 to 69 years, 49% male) were assessed, with an estimated training schedule of 6 to 13 miles/week. At baseline, a decade of chronological aging correlated with a decrease in Ao-A, Ao-P, and Ao-D distensibility by 2.3, 1.9, and 3.1 x 10(-3) mm Hg(-1), respectively (p < 0.05 for all). Training decreased systolic and diastolic central (aortic) blood pressure by 4 mm Hg (95% CI: 2.8 to 5.5 mm Hg) and 3 mm Hg (95% CI: 1.6 to 3.5 mm Hg). Descending aortic distensibility increased (Ao-P: 9%; p = 0.009; Ao-D: 16%; p = 0.002), while remaining unchanged in the Ao-A. These translated to a reduction in "aortic age" by 3.9 years (95% CI: 1.1 to 7.6 years) and 4.0 years (95% CI: 1.7 to 8.0 years) (Ao-P and Ao-D, respectively). Benefit was greater in older, male participants with slower running times (p < 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Training for and completing a marathon even at relatively low exercise intensity reduces central blood pressure and aortic stiffness-equivalent to a approximately 4-year reduction in vascular age. Greater rejuvenation was observed in older, slower individuals.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Wave intensity analysis (WIA) in the aorta offers important clinical and mechanistic insight into ventriculo-arterial coupling, but is difficult to measure non-invasively. We performed WIA by combining standard cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) flow-velocity and non-invasive central blood pressure (cBP) waveforms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two hundred and six healthy volunteers (age range 21-73 years, 47% male) underwent sequential phase contrast CMR (Siemens Aera 1.5 T, 1.97 x 1.77 mm2, 9.2 ms temporal resolution) and supra-systolic oscillometric cBP measurement (200 Hz). Velocity (U) and central pressure (P) waveforms were aligned using the waveform foot, and local wave speed was calculated both from the PU-loop (c) and the sum of squares method (cSS). These were compared with CMR transit time derived aortic arch pulse wave velocity (PWVtt). Associations were examined using multivariable regression. The peak intensity of the initial compression wave, backward compression wave, and forward decompression wave were 69.5 +/- 28, -6.6 +/- 4.2, and 6.2 +/- 2.5 x 104 W/m2/cycle2, respectively; reflection index was 0.10 +/- 0.06. PWVtt correlated with c or cSS (r = 0.60 and 0.68, respectively, P < 0.01 for both). Increasing age decade and female sex were independently associated with decreased forward compression wave (-8.6 and -20.7 W/m2/cycle2, respectively, P < 0.01) and greater wave reflection index (0.02 and 0.03, respectively, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This novel non-invasive technique permits straightforward measurement of wave intensity at scale. Local wave speed showed good agreement with PWVtt, and correlation was stronger using the cSS than the PU-loop. Ageing and female sex were associated with poorer ventriculo-arterial coupling in healthy individuals.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in aortic stenosis (AS) varies widely before and after aortic valve replacement (AVR), and deeper phenotyping beyond traditional global measures may improve risk stratification. We hypothesized that machine learning derived 3D LV models may provide a more sensitive assessment of remodelling and sex-related differences in AS than conventional measurements. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and sixteen patients with severe, symptomatic AS (54% male, 70 +/- 10 years) underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance pre-AVR and 1 year post-AVR. Computational analysis produced co-registered 3D models of wall thickness, which were compared with 40 propensity-matched healthy controls. Preoperative regional wall thickness and post-operative percentage wall thickness regression were analysed, stratified by sex. AS hypertrophy and regression post-AVR was non-uniform-greatest in the septum with more pronounced changes in males than females (wall thickness regression: -13 +/- 3.6 vs. -6 +/- 1.9%, respectively, P < 0.05). Even patients without LVH (16% with normal indexed LV mass, 79% female) had greater septal and inferior wall thickness compared with controls (8.8 +/- 1.6 vs. 6.6 +/- 1.2 mm, P < 0.05), which regressed post-AVR. These differences were not detectable by global measures of remodelling. Changes to clinical parameters post-AVR were also greater in males: N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) [-37 (interquartile range -88 to -2) vs. -1 (-24 to 11) ng/L, P = 0.008], and systolic blood pressure (12.9 +/- 23 vs. 2.1 +/- 17 mmHg, P = 0.009), with changes in NT-proBNP correlating with percentage LV mass regression in males only (ss 0.32, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: In patients with severe AS, including those without overt LVH, LV remodelling is most plastic in the septum, and greater in males, both pre-AVR and post-AVR. Three-dimensional machine learning is more sensitive than conventional analysis to these changes, potentially enhancing risk stratification.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sleep and physical activity (PA) are important lifestyle-related behaviors that impact cardiometabolic health. This study investigated the joint associations of daily step count and sleep patterns (regularity and duration) with cardiometabolic biomarkers in adults. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using pooled data from the Prospective PA, Sitting, and Sleep Consortium, comprising 6 cohorts across Europe and Australia with thigh-worn accelerometry data collected between 2011 and 2021. The sleep regularity index, a metric that quantifies day-to-day sleep consistency, sleep duration (h/d), and steps (per day), was derived from the accelerometer data and categorized based on tertiles and sleep duration guidelines. We used multivariate generalized linear models to examine joint associations of sleep patterns and total daily step count with individual cardiometabolic biomarkers, including body mass index, waist circumference, total cholesterol, HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, triglycerides, HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin), and a composite cardiometabolic health score (mean of the 6 standardized biomarker Z scores). RESULTS: The sample included 11 903 adults with a mean+/-SD age of 54.7+/-9.5 years, 54.9% female, a sleep regularity index of 78.7+/-10.4, and 10 206.4+/-3442.2 daily steps. Lower PA (<8475 steps/d) combined with either lower sleep regularity (sleep regularity index <75.9) or short sleep duration (<7 h/d) was associated with the least favorable composite cardiometabolic health. The corresponding Z scores (95% CI) were 0.34 (0.30-0.38) and 0.26 (0.22-0.31) compared with those with optimal sleep (sleep regularity index >84.5 or 7-8 h/d) and high step count (>11 553 steps/d). The combination of low sleep regularity and low daily steps was associated with higher body mass index (2.92 [2.61-3.24] kg/m(2)), waist circumference (8.58 [7.78-9.38] cm), total cholesterol (0.15 [0.07-0.23] mmol/L), and lower HDL levels (0.17 [0.14-0.2] mmol/L), regardless of sleep duration. The combination of short sleep and low step count had the strongest unfavorable associations for body mass index (2.31 [1.98-2.65] kg/m(2)) and waist circumference (7.01 [6.15-7.87] cm). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the potential deleterious associations of irregular or insufficient sleep with cardiometabolic health outcomes may be exaggerated by lower daily PA. Investigation of the prospective joint association of sleep patterns and PA with cardiometabolic health may be warranted.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Carotid endoluminal intervention is an alternative to surgery but carries a risk of embolic stroke even with distal protection devices. We investigated the clinical features and degree of stenosis related to number and size of emboli during carotid angioplasty. DESIGN: An experimental ex vivo study. MATERIALS: An ex vivo pulsatile flow model was used in which temperature, velocity, flow, pressure and viscosity characteristics were designed to simulate the carotid circulation. METHODS: Carotid endarterectomy specimens excised as intact cylinders (n = 28) were subjected to a standardised angioplasty procedure using radiological guidance. Emboli collected in filters placed distally were counted and sized using microscopy. RESULTS: Median number of emboli during angioplasty was 133 (range 15-1331). Median size of the largest embolus was 700 microns (range 75-2400). Severity of stenosis correlated with increased maximum size (r = 0.55, p = 0.012). Statin therapy >4 weeks pre-operatively was associated with reduced emboli number and size (54 (range 15-748) vs 247 (range 37-1331) [p = 0.023] and 400 microm (range 75-2400) vs 1300 microm (range 600-2200) [p = 0.022]). CONCLUSIONS: In this model a wide range of emboli number and size were produced. Number and size of embolic particles were highest in patients with high-grade stenoses not receiving statin therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Women who experience adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs; gestational hypertension, preeclampsia (PE), gestational diabetes (GD), preterm birth (PTB), small or large for gestational age, miscarriage, multiple miscarriages, stillbirth, and offspring with major congenital anomalies) have increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). We aimed to compare cardiometabolic health trajectories across the life course between women with and without APOs. METHODS: We studied 187,186 women with a registered pregnancy in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD linked to Hospital Episode Statistics. Fractional polynomial multilevel models were used to compare trajectories of cardiometabolic risk factors (body mass index [BMI], blood pressure [BP], cholesterol, and glucose) between women with and without a history of APOs (individual APOs in any pregnancy and number of APOs). We explored two underlying time axes: (1) time relative to first pregnancy (from 10 years before first pregnancy to 15 years after) and (2) age. Models controlled for age at first pregnancy, residential area deprivation, non-singleton pregnancy, parity, smoking status, ethnicity, and medications use. RESULTS: Women with a history of PE, gestational hypertension, or GD had higher BMI, BP, and glucose 10 years before first pregnancy compared to women without these APOs. These differences persisted 15 years post-first pregnancy. Women with a history of GD had a steeper post-partum rise in glucose. Women who experienced multiple (3 +) miscarriage, stillbirth, and/or medically indicated PTB had higher BP and BMI before and after pregnancy, with BP trajectories converging 15 years after first pregnancy. Women who experienced multiple APOs had the most adverse measurements across all cardiometabolic risk factors, with more unfavourable mean levels with each additional APO. There was little difference in cardiometabolic trajectories between women with and without a history of 1 or 2 miscarriages or congenital anomalies. CONCLUSIONS: Women with APOs had adverse cardiometabolic profiles before first pregnancy, persisting up to 15 years post-pregnancy. Findings highlight the potential for targeted public health interventions to promote good cardiometabolic health in young adults transitioning from contraceptive use to planning pregnancies. APOs may identify young women who could benefit from monitoring CVD risk factors and interventions to improve cardiometabolic health.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Physical inactivity, sedentary behaviour (SB), and inadequate sleep are key behavioural risk factors of cardiometabolic diseases. Each behaviour is mainly considered in isolation, despite clear behavioural and biological interdependencies. The aim of this study was to investigate associations of five-part movement compositions with adiposity and cardiometabolic biomarkers. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from six studies (n = 15 253 participants; five countries) from the Prospective Physical Activity, Sitting and Sleep consortium were analysed. Device-measured time spent in sleep, SB, standing, light-intensity physical activity (LIPA), and moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) made up the composition. Outcomes included body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, HDL cholesterol, total:HDL cholesterol ratio, triglycerides, and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Compositional linear regression examined associations between compositions and outcomes, including modelling time reallocation between behaviours. RESULTS: The average daily composition of the sample (age: 53.7 +/- 9.7 years; 54.7% female) was 7.7 h sleeping, 10.4 h sedentary, 3.1 h standing, 1.5 h LIPA, and 1.3 h MVPA. A greater MVPA proportion and smaller SB proportion were associated with better outcomes. Reallocating time from SB, standing, LIPA, or sleep into MVPA resulted in better scores across all outcomes. For example, replacing 30 min of SB, sleep, standing, or LIPA with MVPA was associated with -0.63 (95% confidence interval -0.48, -0.79), -0.43 (-0.25, -0.59), -0.40 (-0.25, -0.56), and -0.15 (0.05, -0.34) kg/m2 lower BMI, respectively. Greater relative standing time was beneficial, whereas sleep had a detrimental association when replacing LIPA/MVPA and positive association when replacing SB. The minimal displacement of any behaviour into MVPA for improved cardiometabolic health ranged from 3.8 (HbA1c) to 12.7 (triglycerides) min/day. CONCLUSIONS: Compositional data analyses revealed a distinct hierarchy of behaviours. Moderate-vigorous physical activity demonstrated the strongest, most time-efficient protective associations with cardiometabolic outcomes. Theoretical benefits from reallocating SB into sleep, standing, or LIPA required substantial changes in daily activity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects of structured exercise are well-established. Effects of 24-hour movement behaviors captured in free-living settings have received less attention. This cross-sectional study investigated associations between a 24-hour behavior composition comprising 6 parts (sleeping, sedentary behavior, standing, slow walking, fast walking, and combined exercise-like activity [eg, running and cycling]) and systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). METHODS: Data from thigh-worn accelerometers and BP measurements were collected from 6 cohorts in the Prospective Physical Activity, Sitting and Sleep consortium (ProPASS) (n=14 761; mean+/-SD, 54.2+/-9.6 years). Individual participant analysis using compositional data analysis was conducted with adjustments for relevant harmonized covariates. Based on the average sample composition, reallocation plots examined estimated BP reductions through behavioral replacement; the theoretical benefits of optimal (ie, clinically meaningful improvement in SBP [2 mm Hg] or DBP [1 mm Hg]) and minimal (ie, 5-minute reallocation) behavioral replacements were identified. RESULTS: The average 24-hour composition consisted of sleeping (7.13+/-1.19 hours), sedentary behavior (10.7+/-1.9 hours), standing (3.2+/-1.1 hours), slow walking (1.6+/-0.6 hours), fast walking (1.1+/-0.5 hours), and exercise-like activity (16.0+/-16.3 minutes). More time spent exercising or sleeping, relative to other behaviors, was associated with lower BP. An additional 5 minutes of exercise-like activity was associated with estimated reductions of -0.68 mm Hg (95% CI, -0.15, -1.21) SBP and -0.54 mm Hg (95% CI, -0.19, 0.89) DBP. Clinically meaningful improvements in SBP and DBP were estimated after 20 to 27 minutes and 10 to 15 minutes of reallocation of time in other behaviors into additional exercise. Although more time spent being sedentary was adversely associated with SBP and DBP, there was minimal impact of standing or walking. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings reiterate the importance of exercise for BP control, suggesting that small additional amounts of exercise are associated with lower BP in a free-living setting.},

   abstract = {Background We aimed at investigating the association of circulating fatty acids with coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke risk. Methods and Results We conducted an individual-participant data meta-analysis of 5 UK-based cohorts and 1 matched case-control study. Fatty acids (ie, omega-3 docosahexaenoic acid, omega-6 linoleic acid, monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids) were measured at baseline using an automated high-throughput serum nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics platform. Data from 3022 incident CHD cases (13 104 controls) and 1606 incident stroke cases (13 369 controls) were included. Logistic regression was used to model the relation between fatty acids and odds of CHD and stroke, adjusting for demographic and lifestyle variables only (ie, minimally adjusted model) or with further adjustment for other fatty acids (ie, fully adjusted model). Although circulating docosahexaenoic acid, but not linoleic acid, was related to lower CHD risk in the fully adjusted model (odds ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76-0.95 per standard unit of docosahexaenoic acid), there was evidence of high between-study heterogeneity and effect modification by study design. Stroke risk was consistently lower with increasing circulating linoleic acid (odds ratio for fully adjusted model, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.75-0.90). Circulating monounsaturated fatty acids were associated with higher CHD risk across all models and with stroke risk in the fully adjusted model (odds ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.03-1.44). Saturated fatty acids were not related to increased CHD risk in the fully adjusted model (odds ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.82-1.09), or stroke risk. Conclusions We found consistent evidence that linoleic acid was associated with decreased risk of stroke and that monounsaturated fatty acids were associated with increased risk of CHD. The different pattern between CHD and stroke in terms of fatty acids risk profile suggests future studies should be cautious about using composite events. Different study designs are needed to assess which, if any, of the associations observed is causal.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: We have previously demonstrated associations between the urinary proteome profile and coronary artery disease (CAD) in cross-sectional studies. Here, we evaluate the potential of a urinary proteomic panel as a predictor of CAD in the hypertensive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (HACVD) substudy population of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial study. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirty-seven cases with primary CAD endpoint were matched for sex and age to controls who had not reached a CAD endpoint during the study. Spot urine samples were analyzed using CE coupled to Micro-TOF MS. A previously developed 238-marker CE-MS model for diagnosis of CAD (CAD238 ) was assessed for its predictive potential. RESULTS: Sixty urine samples (32 cases; 28 controls; 88% male, mean age 64 +/- 5 years) were analyzed. There was a trend toward healthier values in controls for the CAD model classifier (-0.432 +/- 0.326 versus -0.587 +/- 0.297, p = 0.170), and the CAD model showed statistical significance on Kaplan-Meier survival analysis p = 0.021. We found 190 individual markers out of 1501 urinary peptides that separated cases and controls (AUC >0.6). Of these, 25 peptides were also components of CAD238 . CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A urinary proteome panel originally developed in a cross-sectional study predicts CAD endpoints independent of age and sex in a well-controlled prospective study.},

   abstract = {Aims: Techniques for identifying specific microcirculatory structural changes are desirable. As such, capillary rarefaction constitutes one of the earliest changes of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) in cardiac allograft recipients, but its identification with coronary flow reserve (CFR) or intracoronary resistance measurements is hampered because of non-selective interrogation of the capillary bed. We therefore investigated the potential of wave intensity analysis (WIA) to assess capillary rarefaction and thereby predict CAV. Methods and results: Fifty-two allograft patients with unobstructed coronary arteries and normal left ventricular (LV) function were assessed. Adequate aortic pressure and left anterior descending artery flow measurements at rest and with intracoronary adenosine were obtained in 46 of which 2 were lost to follow-up. In a subgroup of 15 patients, simultaneous RV biopsies were obtained and analysed for capillary density. Patients were followed up with 1-3 yearly screening angiography. A significant relationship with capillary density was noted with CFR (r = 0.52, P = 0.048) and the backward decompression wave (BDW) (r = -0.65, P < 0.01). Over a mean follow-up of 9.3 +/- 5.2 years patients with a smaller BDW had an increased risk of developing angiographic CAV (hazard ratio 2.89, 95% CI 1.12-7.39; P = 0.03). Additionally, the index BDW was lower in those who went on to have a clinical CAV-events (P = 0.04) as well as more severe disease (P = 0.01). Conclusions: Within cardiac transplant patients, WIA is able to quantify the earliest histological changes of CAV and can predict clinical and angiographic outcomes. This proof-of-concept for WIA also lends weight to its use in the assessment of other disease processes in which capillary rarefaction is involved.},

   abstract = {Wave intensity analysis (WIA) has found particular applicability in the coronary circulation where it can quantify traveling waves that accelerate and decelerate blood flow. The most important wave for the regulation of flow is the backward-traveling decompression wave (BDW). Coronary WIA has hitherto always been calculated from invasive measures of pressure and flow. However, recently it has become feasible to obtain estimates of these waveforms noninvasively. In this study we set out to assess the agreement between invasive and noninvasive coronary WIA at rest and measure the effect of exercise. Twenty-two patients (mean age 60) with unobstructed coronaries underwent invasive WIA in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Immediately afterwards, noninvasive LAD flow and pressure were recorded and WIA calculated from pulsed-wave Doppler coronary flow velocity and central blood pressure waveforms measured using a cuff-based technique. Nine of these patients underwent noninvasive coronary WIA assessment during exercise. A pattern of six waves were observed in both modalities. The BDW was similar between invasive and noninvasive measures [peak: 14.9 +/- 7.8 vs. -13.8 +/- 7.1 x 10(4) W.m(-2).s(-2), concordance correlation coefficient (CCC): 0.73, P < 0.01; cumulative: -64.4 +/- 32.8 vs. -59.4 +/- 34.2 x 10(2) W.m(-2).s(-1), CCC: 0.66, P < 0.01], but smaller waves were underestimated noninvasively. Increased left ventricular mass correlated with a decreased noninvasive BDW fraction (r = -0.48, P = 0.02). Exercise increased the BDW: at maximum exercise peak BDW was -47.0 +/- 29.5 x 10(4) W.m(-2).s(-2) (P < 0.01 vs. rest) and cumulative BDW -19.2 +/- 12.6 x 10(3) W.m(-2).s(-1) (P < 0.01 vs. rest). The BDW can be measured noninvasively with acceptable reliably potentially simplifying assessments and increasing the applicability of coronary WIA.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Increasing evidence suggests that COVID-19 survivors experience long-term cardiovascular complications possibly through development of vascular damage. The study aimed to investigate whether accelerated vascular ageing occurs after COVID-19 infection, and if so, identify its determinants. METHODS: This prospective, multicentric, cohort study, included 34 centres in 16 countries worldwide, in 4 groups of participants-COVID-19-negative controls (ⅰ) and three groups of individuals with recent (6 +/- 3 months) exposure to SARS-CoV-2: not hospitalized (ⅱ), hospitalized in general wards (ⅲ), and hospitalized in intensive care units (ⅳ). The main outcome was carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), an established biomarker of large artery stiffness. RESULTS: 2390 individuals (age 50 +/- 15 years, 49.2% women) were recruited. After adjustment for confounders, all COVID-19-positive groups showed higher PWV (+0.41, +0.37, and +0.40 m/s for groups 2-4, P < .001, P = .001 and P = .003) vs. controls [PWV 7.53 (7.09; 7.97) m/s adjusted mean (95% CI)]. In sex-stratified analyses, PWV differences were significant in women [PWV (+0.55, +0.60, and +1.09 m/s for groups 2-4, P < .001 for all)], but not in men. Among COVID-19 positive women, persistent symptoms were associated with higher PWV, regardless of disease severity and cardiovascular confounders [adjusted PWV 7.52 (95% CI 7.09; 7.96) vs. 7.13 (95% CI 6.67; 7.59) m/s, P < .001]. A stable or improved PWV after 12 months was found in the COVID+ groups, whereas a progression was observed in the COVID- group. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with early vascular ageing in the long term, especially in women.},

   abstract = {In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) spread rapidly worldwide. Although the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are dominated by respiratory symptoms, the cardiovascular system is extensively affected at multiple levels. Due to the unprecedented consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ARTERY society decided to launch the Covid-19 effects on ARTErial StIffness and vascular AgeiNg (CARTESIAN) study - the first international multicentre study into the effects of COVID-19 on non-invasive biomarkers of vascular ageing. The main study objective is to evaluate the presence of Early Vascular Ageing (EVA) 6 and 12 months after COVID-19 infection. Secondary objectives are to study the effect of COVID-19 disease severity on EVA, to investigate the role of psychosocial factors in COVID-19 induced EVA, and to investigate the potential modifying effect of comorbidities and chronic treatments. In the CARTESIAN study, a broad array of cardiovascular measurements, including carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, central blood pressure, carotid ultrasound, brachial flow-mediated dilatation, will be performed. To date, 43 centres from 21 countries have agreed to participate, with an expected study population of >2500 individuals. To our knowledge, CARTESIAN will be the first study to provide insight into the relationship between COVID-19, its severity, and early vascular ageing in a large cohort, potentially enabling future care and diagnostics to be more focused on the most vulnerable.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Accurate measurement of central blood pressure (BP) using upper arm cuff-based methods is associated with several factors, including determining the level of systolic BP (SBP) amplification. This study aimed to determine the agreement between cuff-based and invasively measured SBP amplification. METHODS: Patients undergoing coronary angiography had invasive SBP amplification (brachial SBP - central SBP) measured simultaneously with cuff-based SBP amplification using a commercially available central BP device (device 1: Sphygmocor Xcel; n = 171, 70% men, 60 +/- 10 years) and a now superseded model of a central BP device (device 2: Uscom BP+; n = 52, 83% men, 62 +/- 10 years). RESULTS: Mean difference (+/-2SD, limits of agreement) between cuff-based and invasive SBP amplification was 4 mmHg (-12, +20 mmHg, P < 0.001) for device 1 and -2 mmHg (-14, +10 mmHg, P = 0.10) for device 2. Both devices systematically overestimated SBP amplification at lower levels and underestimated at higher levels of invasive SBP amplification, but with stronger bias for device 1 (r = -0.68 vs. r = -0.52; Z = 2.72; P = 0.008). Concordance of cuff-based and invasive SBP amplification across quartiles of invasive SBP amplification was low, particularly in the lowest and highest quartiles. The root mean square errors from regression between cuff-based central SBP and brachial SBP were significantly lower (indicating less variability) than from invasive regression models (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Irrespective of the difference from invasive measurements, cuff-based estimates of SBP amplification showed evidence of proportional systematic bias and had less individual variability. These observations could provide insights on how to improve the performance of cuff-based central BP.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vascular status following renal transplantation (RT) may improve while living kidney donation (LKD) is possibly associated with an increased cardiovascular risk. METHODS: We prospectively assessed glomerular filtration rate (mGFR, 51Chrome EDTA clearance) and intermediate vascular risk factors in terms of blood pressure (BP), pulse wave velocity (PWV), central augmentation index (AIx), excess pressure (Pexcess), and forearm vascular resistance in donors (n = 58, 45 +/- 13 years) and recipients (n = 51, 50 +/- 12 years) before and one year following LKD or RT. RESULTS: After kidney donation, mGFR decreased by 33% to 65 +/- 11 ml/min/1.73m2, while recipients obtained a mGFR of 55 +/- 9 ml/min/1.73m.2 Ambulatory 24-hour mean arterial BP (MAP) remained unchanged in donors but decreased by 5 mm Hg in recipients (P < 0.05). Carotid-femoral PWV increased by 0.3 m/s in donors (P < 0.05) but remained unchanged in recipients. AIx was unaltered after LKD but decreased following RT (P < 0.01), and Pexcess did not change in either group. Resting forearm resistance (Rrest), measured by venous occlusion plethysmography, increased after LKD (P < 0.05) but was unaffected by RT, while no changes were seen in minimum resistance (Rmin). DeltaPWV showed a positive linear association to Delta24-hour MAP in both groups. Multiple linear regression analysis (adjusting for age, gender, and the baseline value of the studied parameter) did not detect independent effects of graft function on 24-hour MAP, PWV, AIx, vascular resistance, or Pexcess, whereas low post-donation GFR was related to higher AIx and Rrest. CONCLUSIONS: RT reduced BP and AIx without affecting PWV, whereas LKD resulted in increased PWV and Rrest, despite unchanged BP.},

   abstract = {Background This study examined the association between ideal cardiovascular health ( CVH ) and the retinal microvasculature in midadulthood. Methods and Results The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study included children from 5 Finnish University cities, who were chosen randomly from the national population register. Participants ranged from 12 to 18 years in childhood (1986) and from 37 to 43 years in midadulthood (2011). Ideal CVH was defined according to the American Heart Association criteria. Retinal microvascular measures included diameters, lengths, length:diameter ratio, and tortuosity. From childhood to adulthood, fasting plasma glucose and blood pressure were significantly higher in those with impaired fasting glucose or diabetes mellitus. Childhood ideal CVH was negatively associated with adult arteriolar tortuosity (beta=-0.008; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.01 to -0.003; P=0.001). Improved ideal CVH from childhood to adulthood was positively associated with adult arteriolar diameter (beta=0.122; 95% CI, 0.01-0.24; P=0.033) and negatively associated with adult length:diameter ratio (beta=-0.666; 95% CI, -1.25 to -0.08; P=0.026). When stratified by glucose metabolism, among those with diabetes mellitus and impaired fasting glucose, there was a negative association between childhood ideal CVH and adult venular diameter (diabetes mellitus: beta=-2.75; 95% CI , -5.46 to -0.04; P=0.047; impaired fasting glucose: beta=-2.13; 95% CI, -4.18 to -0.08; P=0.042). Conclusions This study is the first to comprehensively examine the impact of CVH from childhood to midadulthood on quantitative measures of the retinal microvasculature. Ideal CVH in childhood and improvement in CVH from childhood to adulthood appears to have a protective effect on the retinal microvasculature in those with, without, and at risk of diabetes mellitus.},

Isoprenaline, salbutamol, salmefamol, adrenaline and noradrenaline all stimulated acid output over a concentration range of 2 X 10(-7) M--10(-5) M. 3. These responses were antagonized by propranolol (2 X 10(-5) M), pindolol and timolol (10(-6) M). 4. The antagonism of isoprenaline and salmefamol by propranolol was consistent with competitive inhibition. 5. Selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (practolol, atenolol, butoxamine and ICI 118 551) caused significant inhibition of noradrenaline-stimulated secretion but not of that due to the other agonists. 6. An adult rat isolated mucosa preparation responded to adrenaline in a similar manner to the immature stomach preparation. 7. Acid secretion stimulated by beta-adrenoceptor agonists was not antagonized by atropine (10(-5) M), metiamide (10(-4) M) or prostaglandin E2 (10(-5) M). The concentrations of these three antagonists caused marked inhibition of the responses to submaximal concentrations of bethanechol, histamine and pentagastrin respectively. 8. The results are discussed in relation to the possible mechanisms of action of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation of acid secretion: it is concluded that the response is probably mediated by beta-receptors on the parietal cell.},

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a semi-automated software for fast CFV computation using contrast bolus tracking techniques in angiography and compare its performance against experts. The study included patients undergoing coronary angiography. Two experts measured the CFV using the number of frames, segment length, and frame rate. Measurements were repeated for shorter segments and different projections, and their estimations were compared with the software. In total, 123 patients (152 vessels) were included. The software had excellent reproducibility in measuring CFV (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = .995), which was superior to experts (ICC = .946) and provided similar estimations irrespective of the segment length (ICC = .992); conversely, the experts overestimated CFV in short segments. The reproducibility of the experts and the software was moderate when comparing CFV measurements in different projections (first expert vs software ICC = .807, second expert vs software ICC = .790, first expert vs second expert ICC = .885). The software provides reproducible CFV estimations that are close to experts' estimations. Further validation against wire-based functional techniques is needed to examine its potential in assessing microvascular function.},

In this Perspectives article, we explain some fundamental principles of fractal geometry and place it in a familiar medical setting. We summarize studies in the cardiovascular sciences in which fractal methods have successfully been used to investigate disease mechanisms, and suggest potential future clinical roles in cardiac imaging and time series measurements. We believe that clinical researchers can deploy innovative fractal solutions to common cardiac problems that might ultimately translate into advancements for patient care.},

   abstract = {Background We aimed to quantify the role of the plasma metabolic profile in explaining the effect of adiposity on cardiac structure. Methods and Results Body mass index (BMI) was measured at age 11 in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Left ventricular mass indexed to height(2.7) (LVMI) was assessed by echocardiography at age 17. The metabolic profile was quantified via (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy at age 15. Multivariable confounder (maternal age, parity, highest qualification, maternal smoking, prepregnancy BMI, prepregnancy height, household social class, adolescent birthweight, adolescent smoking, fruit and vegetable consumption, and physical activity)-adjusted linear regression estimated the association of BMI with LVMI and mediation by metabolic traits. We considered 156 metabolomic traits individually and jointly as principal components explaining 95% of the variance in the nuclear magnetic resonance platform and assessed whether the principal components for the metabolic traits added to the proportion of the association explained by putative cardiovascular risk factors (systolic and diastolic blood pressures, insulin, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose). A 1 kg/m(2) higher BMI was associated with a 0.70 g/m(2.7) (95% CI, 0.53-0.88 g/m(2.7)) and 0.66 g/m(2.7) (95% CI, 0.53-0.79 g/m(2.7)) higher LVMI in males (n=437) and females (n=536), respectively. Putative risk factors explained 3% (95% CI, 2%-5%) of this association in males, increasing to 10% (95% CI, 8%-13%) when including metabolic principal components. In females, the standard risk factors explained 3% (95% CI, 2%-5%) of the association and did not increase when including the metabolic principal components. Conclusions The addition of the nuclear magnetic resonance-measured metabolic traits appears to mediate more of the association of BMI on LVMI than the putative risk factors alone in adolescent males, but not females.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) refers to the responsiveness of cerebral vasculature to vasoactive stimuli. CVR is an indicator of brain health and can be assessed using vasodilatory techniques and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Using such approaches, some researchers have explored the relationship between CVR and cognition; here we systematically review this work. RESULTS: We extracted information pertaining to: (1) study location and design, participant characteristics, sample sizes, (2) design of vascular challenge, end-tidal CO 2 (etCO 2 ) concentrations (if applicable), (3) MRI protocol, (4) cognitive assessment, (5) CVR values, and outcomes of statistical analyses with cognitive tests. Five studies assessed participants with cognitive impairment compared to controls, one studied patients with multiple sclerosis with or without cognitive impairment compared to controls, one examined patients with moyamoya disease with or without cognitive impairment, two investigated patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and one was a cross-sectional study with younger and older healthy adults. Cognition was typically probed using the MMSE and tests of executive function, while a number of vasodilatory techniques were employed. CONCLUSION: CVR was associated with cognition in six of ten studies, but heterogeneity of study samples, designs and vasodilatory methods may have a role in the inconsistent findings. We make recommendations for future research that includes use of a multi-domain cognitive assessment and standardised hypercapnic challenge with MRI.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Haemodynamic determinants of blood pressure (BP) include cardiac output (CO), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and arterial stiffness. We investigated the heritability of these phenotypes, their association with BP-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and the causal association between BP and arterial stiffness. METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed BP, central BP components, and haemodynamic properties (during a single visit) including CO, SVR, and pulse wave velocity (PWV, measure of arterial stiffness) in 3531 (1934 monozygotic, 1586 dizygotic) female TwinsUK participants. Heritability was estimated using structural equation modelling. Association with 984 BP-associated SNP was examined using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and generalized estimating equation regression. One and two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to estimate the causal direction between BP and arterial stiffness including data on 436 419 UK Biobank participants. We found high heritability for systolic and pulsatile components of BP (>50%) and PWV (65%) with overlapping genes accounting for >50% of their observed correlation. Environmental factors explained most of the variability of CO and SVR (>80%). Regression identified SNPs (n = 5) known to be associated with BP to also be associated with PWV. One-sample MR showed evidence of bi-directional causal association between BP and PWV in TwinsUK participants. Two-sample MR, confirmed a bi-directional causal effect of PWV on BP (inverse variance weighted (IVW) beta = 0.11, P < 0.02) and BP on arterial stiffness (IVW beta = 0.004, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The genetic basis of BP is mediated not only by genes regulating BP but also by genes that influence arterial stiffness. Mendelian randomization indicates a bi-directional causal association between BP and arterial stiffness.},

   abstract = {AIM: To examine impact of adverse childhood experiences (ACE) on rates and development of multimorbidity across three decades in adulthood. METHODS: Sample: Participants from the 1946 National Survey of Health and Development, who attended the age 36 assessment in 1982 and follow-up assessments (ages 43, 53, 63, 69; N = 3,264, 51% males). Prospectively collected data on nine ACEs was grouped into (i) psychosocial, (ii) parental health and (iii) childhood health. For each group, we calculated cumulative ACE scores, categorised into 0, 1 and >/=2 ACEs. Multimorbidity was estimated as the total score of 18 health disorders.Serial cross-sectional linear regression was used to estimate associations between grouped ACEs and multimorbidity during follow-up. Longitudinal analysis of ACE-associated changes in multimorbidity trajectories across follow-up was estimated using linear mixed-effects modelling for ACE groups (adjusted for sex and childhood socioeconomic circumstances). FINDINGS: Accumulation of psychosocial and childhood health ACEs were associated with progressively higher multimorbidity scores throughout follow-up. For example, those with >/=2 psychosocial ACEs experienced 0.20(95% CI 0.07, 0.34) more disorders at age 36 than those with none, rising to 0.61(0.18, 1.04) disorders at age 69.All three grouped ACEs were associated with greater rates of accumulation and higher multimorbidity trajectories across adulthood. For example, individuals with >/=2 psychosocial ACEs developed 0.13(-0.09, 0.34) more disorders between ages 36 and 43, 0.29(0.06, 0.52) disorders between ages 53 and 63, and 0.30(0.09, 0.52) disorders between ages 63 and 69 compared with no psychosocial ACEs. INTERPRETATIONS: ACEs are associated with widening inequalities in multimorbidity development in adulthood and early old age. Public health policies should aim to reduce these disparities through individual and population-level interventions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a standard treatment for secondary prevention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in high income countries (HICs), but it is inaccessible to most patients in India due to high costs and skills required for multidisciplinary CR teams. We developed a low-cost and scalable CR program based on culturally-acceptable practice of yoga (Yoga-CaRe). In this paper, we report the rationale and design for evaluation of its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. METHODS: This is a multi-center, single-blind, two-arm parallel-group randomized controlled trial across 22 cardiac care hospitals in India. Four thousand patients aged 18-80years with AMI will be recruited and randomized 1:1 to receive Yoga-CaRe program (13 sessions supervised by an instructor and encouragement to self-practice daily) or enhanced standard care (3 sessions of health education) delivered over a period of three months. Participants will be followed 3-monthly till the end of the trial. The co-primary outcomes are a) time to occurrence of first cardiovascular event (composite of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke and emergency cardiovascular hospitalization), and b) quality of life (Euro-QoL-5L) at 12weeks. Secondary outcomes include need for revascularization procedures, return to pre-infarct activities, tobacco cessation, medication adherence, and cost-effectiveness of the intervention. CONCLUSION: This trial will alone contribute >20% participants to existing meta-analyses of randomized trials of CR worldwide. If Yoga-CaRe is found to be effective, it has the potential to save millions of lives and transform care of AMI patients in India and other low and middle income country settings.},

The objective of this study was to examine whether optimality at bifurcations is affected in individuals with atherosclerosis. Retinal images were analysed in normotensive men with abnormal ankle brachial index (n = 13) and healthy controls (n = 8), matched for age and clinic blood pressure. Compared with controls, men with peripheral vascular disease had adverse metabolic profiles (relative insulin resistance and greater total cholesterol levels). In healthy men, retinal arterial diameters at bifurcations conformed to predicted optimal values but in men with peripheral vascular disease, junction exponents deviated significantly from the optimum. Retinal arteriolar bifurcation angles did not differ significantly between the groups. Atherosclerosis is associated with abnormalities in the arteriolar network of the retina. In view of the importance of the endothelium in maintaining network co-ordination of branch diameters this is suggestive of a generalized abnormality of endothelial function in atherosclerosis.},

   abstract = {The optimal design of vascular networks maximizes circulatory efficiency while minimizing power costs. We investigated the effects of acute changes in vascular tone on retinal arteriolar network geometry. Six hypertensive and six normotensive subjects each breathed air, 5% CO(2) (with 12% O(2)), and 100% O(2) for 5 min periods in random order. Retinal photographs were taken at the end of each test period. Bifurcation angles and arteriolar diameters were measured using operator-directed image analysis, and junction exponents were calculated. Arteriolar diameters narrowed on breathing O(2). The magnitude of this change was significantly greater in normotensive than in hypertensive subjects. Angles narrowed in normotensive subjects, but not significantly in hypertensive subjects. Arteriolar diameters increased significantly on breathing CO(2) in normotensive but not in hypertensive subjects, but there were no changes in angles. Despite changes in diameter, junction exponents did not change under any conditions. Vascular reactivity in the retinal arteriolar bed appears to be diminished in hypertensive subjects. The failure of junction exponents to change, despite alterations in diameter, suggests that arteriolar diameters at retinal bifurcations adhere to optimality principles when exposed to acute vasoactive stress. As vasoconstriction is associated with the narrowing of bifurcation angles, previous observations showing narrowed angles in hypertensive subjects could be explained by increased tone in the retinal arteriolar bed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low birth weight is associated with hypertension and increased cardiovascular mortality, but the mechanism of this association is not known. Hypertension is accompanied by abnormalities of the microvasculature including rarefaction. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that low birth weight is associated with an alteration in microvascular architecture. DESIGN: A stratified random sample of 100 men aged 64-74 years was selected from a cohort of men whose birth weights were known. They were of relatively high or low birth weight ('high' > or = 3700 g, 'low' < or = 3200 g) and high or low systolic blood pressure (high > or = 160 mmHg, low < or = 140 mmHg). METHODS: Retinal arteriolar geometry was defined in terms of arteriolar bifurcation angles and junction exponents (a measure of the relative diameters of parent and daughter vessels), measured from photographic diapositives using operator-directed image analysis. RESULTS: Members of low-birth-weight groups had significantly narrower bifurcation angles than did members of high-birth-weight groups (74 +/- 1 degree versus 78 +/- 1 degree, P= 0.017 by analysis of variance). There was no significant difference between angles in members of groups with high and low blood pressures. Neither birth weight nor blood pressure grouping affected junction exponents. CONCLUSIONS: Narrower bifurcation angles are associated with increased circulatory energy costs and may be related to a lower than normal microvascular density. Our finding of differences in retinal microvascular architecture might reflect a persistent alteration in vascular architecture as a result of an impairment of foetal development and could provide a mechanistic link between low birth weight and subsequently increased cardiovascular risk.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Quantification of retinal vascular change is difficult and manual measurements of vascular features are slow and subject to observer bias. These problems may be overcome using computer algorithms. Three automated methods and a manual method for measurement of arteriolar diameters from digitised red-free retinal photographs were compared. METHODS: 60 diameters (in pixels) measured by manual identification of vessel edges in red-free retinal images were compared with diameters measured by (1) fitting vessel intensity profiles to a double Gaussian function by non-linear regression, (2) a standard edge detection algorithm (Sobel), and (3) determination of points of maximum intensity variation by a sliding linear regression filter (SLRF). Method agreement was analysed using Bland-Altman plots and the repeatability of each method was assessed. RESULTS: Diameter estimations obtained using the SLRF method were the least scattered although diameters obtained were approximately 3 pixels greater than those measured manually. The SLRF method was the most repeatable and the Gaussian method less so. The Sobel method was the least consistent owing to frequent misinterpretation of the light reflex as the vessel edge. CONCLUSION: Of the three automated methods compared, the SLRF method was the most consistent (defined as the method producing diameter estimations with the least scatter) and the most repeatable in measurements of retinal arteriolar diameter. Application of automated methods of retinal vascular analysis may be useful in the assessment of cardiovascular and other diseases.},

Methods and results: Smoking and alcohol use were assessed by questionnaires at 13, 15, and 17 years in 1266 participants (425 males and 841 females) from the ALSPAC study. Smoking status (smokers and non-smoker) and intensity ('high' >/=100, 'moderate' 20-99, and 'low or never' <20 cigarettes in lifetime) were ascertained. Participants were classified by frequency (low or high) and intensity of drinking [light (LI <2), medium (MI 3-9), and heavy (HI >10 drinks on a typical drinking day)]. Carotid to femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was assessed at 17 years [mean +/- standard deviation and/or mean difference (95% confidence intervals)]. Current smokers had higher PWV compared with non-smokers (P = 0.003). Higher smoking exposure was associated with higher PWV compared with non-smokers [5.81 +/- 0.725 vs. 5.71 +/- 0.677 m/s, mean adjusted difference 0.211 (0.087-0.334) m/s, P = 0.001]. Participants who stopped smoking had similar PWV to never smokers (P = 0.160). High-intensity drinkers had increased PWV [HI 5.85 +/- 0.8 vs. LI 5.67 +/- 0.604 m/s, mean adjusted difference 0.266 (0.055-0.476) m/s, P = 0.013]. There was an additive effect of smoking intensity and alcohol intensity, so that 'high' smokers who were also HI drinkers had higher PWV compared with never-smokers and LI drinkers [mean adjusted increase 0.603 (0.229-0.978) m/s, P = 0.002]. Conclusion: Smoking exposure even at low levels and intensity of alcohol use were associated individually and together with increased arterial stiffness. Public health strategies need to prevent adoption of these habits in adolescence to preserve or restore arterial health.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: As people age, circulating levels of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) decline. In rat cardiomyocytes, IGF-I has been shown to regulate sarcolemmal potassium channel activity and late sodium current thus impacting cardiac repolarization and the heart rate-corrected QT (QTc). However, the relationship between IGFs and IGFBP-3 with the QTc interval in humans, is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To examine the association of IGFs and IGFBP-3 with QTc interval in an older age population-based cohort. METHODS: Participants were from the 1946 Medical Research Council (MRC) National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) British birth cohort. Biomarkers from blood samples at age 53 and 60-64 years (y, exposures) included IGF-I/II, IGFBP-3, IGF-I/IGFBP-3 ratio and the change (Delta) in marker levels between the 60-64 and 53y sampled timepoints. QTc (outcome) was recorded from electrocardiograms at the 60-64y timepoint. Generalized linear multivariable models with adjustments for relevant demographic and clinical factors, were used for complete-cases and repeated after multiple imputation. RESULTS: One thousand four hundred forty-eight participants were included (48.3% men; QTc mean 414 ms interquartile range 26 ms). Univariate analysis revealed an association between low IGF-I and IGF-I/IGFBP-3 ratio at 60-64y with QTc prolongation [respectively: beta -0.30 ms/nmol/L, (95% confidence intervals -0.44, -0.17), p < 0.001; beta-28.9 ms/unit (-41.93, -15.50), p < 0.001], but not with IGF-II or IGFBP-3. No association with QTc was found for IGF biomarkers sampled at 53y, however both DeltaIGF-I and DeltaIGF-I/IGFBP-3 ratio were negatively associated with QTc [beta -0.04 ms/nmol/L (-0.08, -0.008), p = 0.019; beta -2.44 ms/unit (-4.17, -0.67), p = 0.007] while DeltaIGF-II and DeltaIGFBP-3 showed no association. In fully adjusted complete case and imputed models (reporting latter) low IGF-I and IGF-I/IGFBP-3 ratio at 60-64y [beta -0.21 ms/nmol/L (-0.39, -0.04), p = 0.017; beta -20.14 ms/unit (-36.28, -3.99), p = 0.015], steeper decline in DeltaIGF-I [beta -0.05 ms/nmol/L/10 years (-0.10, -0.002), p = 0.042] and shallower rise in DeltaIGF-I/IGFBP-3 ratio over a decade [beta -2.16 ms/unit/10 years (-4.23, -0.09), p = 0.041], were all independently associated with QTc prolongation. Independent associations with QTc were also confirmed for other previously known covariates: female sex [beta 9.65 ms (6.65, 12.65), p < 0.001], increased left ventricular mass [beta 0.04 ms/g (0.02, 0.06), p < 0.001] and blood potassium levels [beta -5.70 ms/mmol/L (-10.23, -1.18) p = 0.014]. CONCLUSION: Over a decade, in an older age population-based cohort, declining levels and bioavailability of IGF-I associate with prolongation of the QTc interval. As QTc prolongation associates with increased risk for sudden death even in apparently healthy people, further research into the antiarrhythmic effects of IGF-I on cardiomyocytes is warranted.},

   abstract = {Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) after myocardial infarction is highly effective. It is unavailable in public hospitals in India due to limited resources. Our objective was to develop a scalable model of CR for India based on yoga, which could also appeal to some groups with low uptake of CR (e.g., ethnic minorities, women, and older people) globally. The intervention was developed using a structured process. A literature review and consultations with yoga experts, CR experts, and postmyocardial infarction patients were conducted to systematically identify and shortlist appropriate yoga exercises and postures, breathing exercises, meditation and relaxation practices, and lifestyle changes, which were incorporated into a conventional CR framework. The draft intervention was further refined based on the feedback from an internal stakeholder group and an external panel of international experts, before being piloted with yoga instructors and patients with myocardial infarction. A four-phase yoga-based CR (Yoga-CaRe) programme was developed for delivery by a single yoga instructor with basic training. The programme consists of a total of 13 instructor-led sessions (2 individual and 11 group) over a 3-month period. Group sessions include guided practice of yoga exercises and postures, breathing exercises, and meditation and relaxation practices, and support for the lifestyle change and coping through a moderated discussion. Patients are encouraged to self-practice daily at home and continue long-term with the help of a booklet and digital video disc (DVD). Family members/carers are encouraged to join throughout. In conclusion, a novel yoga-based CR programme has been developed, which promises to provide a scalable CR solution for India and an alternative choice for CR globally. It is currently being evaluated in a large multicentre randomised controlled trial across India.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stroke mortality rate is higher in South Asians than in Europeans, despite equivalent or lower resting blood pressure (BP). Elevated recovery BP after exercise predicts stroke, independently of resting values. We hypothesized that South Asians would have adverse postexercise hemodynamics and sought explanations for this. METHODS AND RESULTS: A population-based sample of 147 European and 145 South Asian middle-aged men and women performed the Dundee 3-minute step test. Cardiovascular risk factors were measured. BP, heart rate, and rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial oxygen consumption, were compared. With 90% power and 5% significance, we could detect a difference of 0.38 of a standard deviation in any outcome measure. Resting systolic BP was similar in South Asians (144 mm Hg) and Europeans (142 mm Hg) (P=0.2), as was exercise BP (P=0.4). However, recovery systolic BP at 3 minutes after exercise was higher in South Asians by 4.3 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2 to 8.3 mm Hg; P=0.04). This effect persisted when adjusted for exercise BP and work effort (5.4 mm Hg [95% CI, 2.2 to 8.7 mm Hg; P=0.001]). Adjustment for baroreflex insensitivity and greater aortic stiffness in South Asians contributes greatly to attenuating this ethnic difference (1.9 mm Hg [95% CI, -0.9 to 4.6 mm Hg; P=0.4]). Similarly, rate-pressure product recovery after exercise was impaired in South Asians by 735 mm Hg/min (95% CI, 137 to 1334 mm Hg/min; P=0.02); again, adjustment for baroreflex insensitivity and aortic stiffness attenuated this difference (261 mm Hg/min [95% CI, -39 to 561 mm Hg/min; P=0.3]). CONCLUSION: Postexercise recovery of BP and rate-pressure product is impaired in South Asians compared to Europeans even though resting and exercise BP are similar. This is associated with the autonomic dysfunction and aortic stiffness in South Asians.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Indian Asians have high rates of heart disease and stroke, but risks of peripheral arterial disease appear to be low. This paradox, and reasons for it, have not been explored. We compared ethnic differences in peripheral arterial disease for a given level of coronary disease. METHODS: We studied 83 European and 84 Indian Asian men with a range of coronary disease. Extent of coronary atheroma was quantified by coronary artery calcification score on multislice CT. Femoral intima-media thickness (IMT) was measured by ultrasound. RESULTS: Femoral IMT was 1.58, 2.06, 2.12, and 2.69 mm in Europeans, and 0.61, 1.41, 1.81 and 2.29 in Indian Asians by increasing categories of coronary atheroma (p=0.003 for ethnic difference, adjusted for age and lumen diameter). Adjustment for smoking and systolic blood pressure, the only risk factors adversely distributed in Europeans, only partly accounted for this ethnic difference (p=0.05). Other risk factors, including lipids, obesity, insulin and glycaemic status, more adversely distributed in Indian Asians, could not account for ethnic differences. Prevalence of abnormal ankle brachial index and lower limb atherosclerotic plaque was also greater in Europeans. CONCLUSIONS: For a given level of coronary disease, Indian Asians have less lower limb atherosclerosis than Europeans, unexplained by established risk factors. Further study of these populations would help tease out relative contributions of risk factors to atherosclerosis in different vessel beds.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study characterized the determinants of carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) in a large (n > 4,000) longitudinal cohort of healthy young people age 9 to 21 years. BACKGROUND: Greater cIMT is commonly used in the young as a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis, but its evolution at this age is still poorly understood. METHODS: Associations between cardiovascular risk factors and cIMT were investigated in both longitudinal (ages 9 to 17 years) and cross-sectional (ages 17 and 21 years) analyses, with the latter also related to other measures of carotid structure and stress. Additional use of ultra-high frequency ultrasound in the radial artery at age 21 years allowed investigation of the distinct layers (i.e., intima or media) that may underlie observed differences. RESULTS: Fat-free mass (FFM) and systolic blood pressure were the only modifiable risk factors positively associated with cIMT (e.g., mean difference in cIMT per 1-SD increase in FFM at age 17: 0.007 mm: 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.004 to 0.010; p < 0.001), whereas fat mass was negatively associated with cIMT (difference: -0.0032; 95% CI: 0.004 to -0.001; p = 0.001). Similar results were obtained when investigating cumulative exposure to these factors throughout adolescence. An increase in cIMT maintained circumferential wall stress in the face of increased mean arterial pressure when increases in body mass were attributable to increased FFM, but not fat mass. Risk factor-associated differences in the radial artery occurred in the media alone, and there was little evidence of a relationship between intimal thickness and any risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: Subtle changes in cIMT in the young may predominantly involve the media and represent physiological adaptations as opposed to subclinical atherosclerosis. Other vascular measures may be more appropriate for the identification of arterial disease before adulthood.},

   abstract = {Background Low-grade inflammation in the young may contribute to the early development of cardiovascular disease. We assessed whether circulating levels of glycoprotein acetyls (GlycA) were better able to predict the development of adverse cardiovascular disease risk profiles compared with the more commonly used biomarker high-sensitivity CRP (C-reactive protein). Methods and Results A total of 3306 adolescents and young adults from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (mean age, 15.4+/-0.3; n=1750) and Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study (mean age, 32.1+/-5.0; n=1556) were included. Baseline associations between inflammatory biomarkers, body composition, cardiovascular risk factors, and subclinical measures of vascular dysfunction were assessed cross-sectionally in both cohorts. Prospective risk of developing hypertension and metabolic syndrome during 9-to-10-year follow-up were also assessed as surrogate markers for future cardiovascular risk. GlycA showed greater within-subject correlation over 9-to-10-year follow-up in both cohorts compared with CRP, particularly in the younger adolescent group (r=0.36 versus 0.07). In multivariable analyses, GlycA was found to associate with multiple lifestyle-related cardiovascular disease risk factors, cardiometabolic risk factor burden, and vascular dysfunction (eg, mean difference in flow-mediated dilation=-1.2 [-1.8, -0.7]% per z-score increase). In contrast, CRP levels appeared predominantly driven by body mass index and showed little relationship to any measured cardiovascular risk factors or phenotypes. In both cohorts, only GlycA predicted future risk of both hypertension (risk ratio [RR], approximately 1.1 per z-score increase for both cohorts) and metabolic syndrome (RR, approximately 1.2-1.3 per z-score increase for both cohorts) in 9-to-10-year follow-up. Conclusions Low-grade inflammation captured by the novel biomarker GlycA is associated with adverse cardiovascular risk profiles from as early as adolescence and predicts future risk of hypertension and metabolic syndrome in up to 10-year follow-up. GlycA is a stable inflammatory biomarker which may capture distinct sources of inflammation in the young and may provide a more sensitive measure than CRP for detecting early cardiovascular risk.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Excessive arterial pulsatility may contribute to cognitive decline and risk of dementia via damage to the fragile cerebral microcirculation. We hypothesized that the intensity of downstream-travelling pulsatile waves measured by wave intensity analysis in the common carotid artery during mid- to late-life would be associated with subsequent cognitive decline. METHODS AND RESULTS: Duplex Doppler ultrasound was used to calculate peak forward-travelling compression wave intensity (FCWI) within the common carotid artery in 3191 individuals [mean +/- standard deviation (SD), age = 61 +/- 6 years; 75% male] assessed as part of the Whitehall II study in 2003-05. Serial measures of cognitive function were taken between 2002-04 and 2015-16. The relationship between FCWI and cognitive decline was adjusted for sociodemographic variables, genetic and health-related risk factors, and health behaviours. Mean (SD) 10-year change in standardized global cognitive score was -0.39 (0.18). Higher FCWI at baseline was associated with accelerated cognitive decline during follow-up [difference in 10-year change of global cognitive score per 1 SD higher FCWI = -0.02 (95% confidence interval -0.04 to -0.00); P = 0.03]. This association was largely driven by cognitive changes in individuals with the highest FCWI [Q4 vs. Q1-Q3 = -0.05 (-0.09 to -0.01), P = 0.01], equivalent to an age effect of 1.9 years. Compared to other participants, this group was approximately 50% more likely to exhibit cognitive decline (defined as the top 15% most rapid reductions in cognitive function during follow-up) even after adjustments for multiple potential confounding factors [odds ratio 1.49 (1.17-1.88)]. CONCLUSION: Elevated carotid artery wave intensity in mid- to late-life predicts faster cognitive decline in long-term follow-up independent of other cardiovascular risk factors.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Excess bodyweight (BMI >25 kg/m(2)) in midlife (age 40-65 years) has been linked to future cognitive decline and an increased risk of dementia. Whether chronic exposure to excess bodyweight in the early decades of life (<40 years) is associated with compromised cognitive function by midlife, however, remains unclear. This study therefore aimed to test potential bidirectional direct and indirect pathways linking cumulative exposure to excess bodyweight and cognitive function in the early decades of life. METHODS: In this longitudinal analysis, harmonised measures of BMI and cognitive function were available in 19 742 participants aged 47-53 years recruited to the 1946 National Survey of Health and Development (n=2131), the 1958 National Child Development Study (n=9385), and the 1970 British Cohort Study (n=8226). Individual BMI trajectories spanning three decades from age 10-40 years were created for each participant and excess bodyweight duration, BMI change between ages, and cumulative excess bodyweight exposure were calculated. Harmonised measures of verbal and non-verbal ability, mathematical ability, and reading ability were used to create a latent factor for childhood cognitive function, and immediate and delayed recall, animal naming, and letter-search speed tests were used for midlife cognitive function. Multivariable linear regression and structural equation models (SEM) were used to test for potential bidirectional relationships between cognition and excess bodyweight in both individual cohorts and pooled datasets while accounting for other potential early-life confounders. FINDINGS: Increases in BMI during adolescence and greater cumulative exposure to excess bodyweight across early life were associated with lower midlife cognitive function in all cohorts (eg, pooled difference in cognitive function per 10 years excess bodyweight duration -0.10; 95% CI -0.12 to -0.08; p<0.001). Further adjustment for childhood cognitive function attenuated many of these associations towards the null (eg, pooled difference in cognitive function per 10 years excess bodyweight duration -0.04; 95% CI -0.06 to -0.02; p=0.001), however, with any remaining associations then fully attenuating once further adjusted for other early-life factors (eg, pooled difference in cognitive function per 10 years excess bodyweight duration 0, -0.03 to 0.01; p=0.38). In the reverse direction, low childhood cognition was associated with greater cumulative exposure to excess bodyweight over the next four decades, although much of this relationship was found to probably be explained via other potentially modifiable upstream early-life factors such as childhood disadvantage. SEM in all cohorts suggested the presence of modest direct and indirect pathways connecting earlier cognitive function to later excess bodyweight, but scarce evidence for an effect of early-life excess bodyweight on cognitive function by midlife. INTERPRETATION: The association between cumulative exposure to excess bodyweight in early life and lower cognitive function in midlife is probably confounded by a persistently lower cognitive function from childhood. Initiatives to improve early-life factors such as childhood disadvantage and education, however, might exert dual but independent benefits on both of these factors before old age.

   abstract = {Obese adults are often reported to have smaller brain volumes than their non-obese peers. Whether this represents evidence of accelerations in obesity-driven atrophy or is instead a legacy of developmental differences established earlier in the lifespan remains unclear. This study investigated whether early-life differences in adiposity explain differences in numerous adult brain traits commonly attributed to mid-life obesity. We used a two-sample life course Mendelian randomization study in 37 501 adults recruited to UK Biobank (UKB) imaging centres from 2014, with secondary analyses in 6996 children assessed in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD) recruited from 2018. Exposures were genetic variants for childhood (266 variants) and adult (470 variants) adiposity derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 407 741 UKB participants. Primary outcomes were: adult total brain volume; grey matter volume, thickness and surface area; white matter volume and hyperintensities; and hippocampus, amygdala and thalamus volumes at mean age 55 in the UKB. Secondary outcomes were equivalent childhood measures collected at mean age 10 in ABCD. In the UKB, individuals who were genetically predicted to have had higher levels of adiposity in childhood were found to have multiple smaller adult brain volumes relative to intracranial volume [e.g. z-score difference in normalized brain volume per category increase in adiposity-95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.20 (-0.28, -0.12); P = 4 x 10-6]. These effect sizes remained essentially unchanged after accounting for birthweight or current adult obesity in multivariable models, whereas most observed adult effects attenuated towards null [e.g. adult z-score (95% CI) for total volume = 0.06 (-0.05, 0.17); P = 0.3]. Observational analyses in ABCD showed a similar pattern of changes already present in those with a high body mass index by age 10 [z-score (95% CI) = -0.10 (-0.13, -0.07); P = 8 x 10-13], with follow-up genetic risk score analyses providing some evidence for a causal effect already at this early age. Sensitivity analyses revealed that many of these effects were likely due to the persistence of larger head sizes established in those who gained excess weight in childhood [childhood z-score (95% CI) for intracranial volume = 0.14 (0.05, 0.23); P = 0.002], rather than smaller brain sizes per se. Our data suggest that the persistence of early-life developmental differences across the life course may underlie numerous neuroimaging traits commonly attributed to obesity-related atrophy in later life.},

   abstract = {A healthy aorta exerts a powerful cushioning function, which limits arterial pulsatility and protects the microvasculature from potentially harmful fluctuations in pressure and blood flow. Large-artery (aortic) stiffening, which occurs with aging and various pathologic states, impairs this cushioning function, and has important consequences on cardiovascular health, including isolated systolic hypertension, excessive penetration of pulsatile energy into the microvasculature of target organs that operate at low vascular resistance, and abnormal ventricular-arterial interactions that promote left ventricular remodeling, dysfunction, and failure. Large-artery stiffness independently predicts cardiovascular risk and represents a high-priority therapeutic target to ameliorate the global burden of cardiovascular disease. This paper provides an overview of key physiologic and biophysical principles related to arterial stiffness, the impact of aortic stiffening on target organs, noninvasive methods for the measurement of arterial stiffness, mechanisms leading to aortic stiffening, therapeutic approaches to reduce it, and clinical applications of arterial stiffness measurements.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is growing concern about the long-term cardiovascular health of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). In this study we assessed the association between JIA polygenic risk and cardiovascular phenotypes (cardiovascular risk factors, early atherosclerosis/arteriosclerosis markers, and cardiac structure and function measures) early in life. METHODS: JIA polygenic risk scores (PRSs) were constructed for 2,815 participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, using the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) weights from the most recent JIA genome wide association study. The association between JIA PRSs and cardiovascular phenotypes at age 24 years was assessed using linear and logistic regression. For outcomes with strong evidence of association, further analysis was undertaken to examine how early in life (from age seven onwards) these associations manifest. RESULTS: The JIA PRS was associated with diastolic blood pressure (beta 0.062, 95% CI 0.026 to 0.099, P = 0.001), insulin (beta 0.050, 95% CI 0.011 to 0.090, P = 0.013), insulin resistance index (HOMA2_IR, beta 0.054, 95% CI 0.014 to 0.095, P = 0.009), log hsCRP (beta 0.053, 95% CI 0.011 to 0.095, P = 0.014), waist circumference (beta 0.041, 95% CI 0.007 to 0.075, P = 0.017), fat mass index (beta 0.049, 95% CI 0.016 to 0.083, P = 0.004) and body mass index (beta 0.046, 95% CI 0.011 to 0.081, P = 0.010). For anthropometric measures and diastolic blood pressure, there was suggestive evidence of association with JIA PRS from age seven years. The findings were consistent across multiple sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic liability to JIA is associated with multiple cardiovascular risk factors, supporting the hypothesis of increased cardiovascular risk in JIA. Our findings suggest that cardiovascular risk is a core feature of JIA, rather than secondary to the disease activity/treatment, and that cardiovascular risk counselling should form part of patient care.},

   abstract = {1. In this study the effect of lovastatin, an inhibitor of cholesterol and isoprenoid synthesis, on the rises in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) induced by platelet derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB), angiotensin II (AII), low density lipoproteins (LDL) and foetal calf serum (FCS) was examined in human cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from saphenous vein. Changes in [Ca2+]i were measured in cell suspensions by the Ca2+ sensitive probe, fura 2. 2. Incubation with lovastatin for 24-26 h markedly reduced the peak rise and sustained phase of [Ca2+]i elevation in response to PDGF-BB but the responses to AII, LDL and FCS were unaffected. Further experiments showed that lovastatin pretreatment inhibited PDGF-BB induced Ca2+ influx but not intracellular Ca2+ release. This inhibition could be overcome by co-incubation with mevalonic acid. 3. Pretreatment of cells with the heterotrimeric G protein inhibitor pertussis toxin for up to 24 h completely abolished AII-induced [Ca2+]i rises but the response to PDGF-BB was unaffected. 4. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein largely abolished PDGF-BB-induced [Ca2+]i elevation but had no significant effect on AII-induced responses. 5. Pre-incubation with lovastatin had no effect on the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGF-beta receptors (as measured by Western blot) in response to the PDGF-BB ligand. 6. PDGF-BB elicits Ca2+ influx via a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism distinct from the heterotrimeric G protein coupled pathway utilized by AII. Lovastatin most likely acts by inhibition of isoprenylation (via blockade of isoprenoid synthesis) of an intermediate molecule involved in PDGF-BB-induced Ca2+ influx.},

   abstract = {The effect of the three platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) isoforms AA, AB, and BE on migration was investigated in cultured human saphenous vein smooth muscle cells. The modified Boyden chamber technique yielded efficacies BB much greater than AB, AA=0. However, the BE concentration-response relationship displayed a pronounced peak, occurring between 1 and 10 ng/mL, with no response above this range. Checkerboard analysis showed that the promotion of migration at low concentrations was chemotactic in nature but that the downturn was independent of gradient. Furthermore, at high concentrations BE was able to prevent chemotaxis induced by fetal calf serum and epidermal growth factor (EGF). Experiments using low concentrations of BE in combination with high concentrations of AA to saturate PDGF alpha-receptors in the presence and absence of a neutralizing antibody to alpha-receptors revealed that alpha-receptor activation induced partial inhibition of chemotaxis but this did not account for the inhibition of migration by high concentrations of BE. Despite possessing no significant chemotactic action itself, high concentrations of the AB isoform completely inhibited BE induced chemotaxis. Taken together these results suggest that the chemotactic signal induced by PDGF is dominated by PDGF beta-receptors and switches from positive at low concentrations to negative at higher concentrations. Stimulation of DNA synthesis by the three isoforms (as measured by [H-3] thymidine incorporation) yielded saturable responses for the AB and BB isoforms, with similar efficacy and weak or no response for the AA isoform. Concentration-dependent patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation of certain proteins mirrored the form of,the chemotactic response and suggest one possible underlying regulatory mechanism to account for the disparity between PDGF-induced chemotaxis and DNA synthesis.},

Watanabe heritable hyperpercholesterolaemic rabbits (WHHL) possess defective receptors for low density lipoprotein leading to increased plasma cholesterol, accumulation of cholesterol in the arterial wall and atherosclerosis. In this study calcium channel currents (IBa) were compared using conventional whole cell voltage clamp techniques in ear artery cells isolated from control New Zealand White rabbits (NZ) with those from WHHL. IBa were larger in cells isolated from NZ than from WHHL, however cell capacitance was also greater in NZ cells. Consequently, there was no significant difference in current density between NZ and WHHL cells either in the absence of drug or in the presence of the calcium channel agonist (+)202 791. Current voltage-relationships, kinetics of fast inactivation and steady-state inactivation of IBa also did not differ significantly between WHHL and NZ. These findings suggest that hypercholesterolaemia in WHHL has no direct effect on calcium channel current density or voltage-modulation in arterial smooth muscle cells.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) exhibit systemic endothelial dysfunction, which can be associated with myocardial ischaemia in absence of obstructive coronary disease. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is used to treat severe AS in patients with high or prohibitive surgical risk. However, it remains unknown whether endothelial function recovers post-TAVR. We therefore sought to assess the early and late changes in flow-mediated dilation (FMD), a measure of endothelial function, following TAVR. METHODS: Patients undergoing TAVR for severe AS had ultrasound assessment of brachial endothelial-independent and -dependent FMD. Measurements were performed pre-TAVR, at early follow-up (<48 h post-TAVR) and late follow-up (4-6 weeks post-TAVR). RESULTS: 27 patients (mean age 82.0 +/- 7.0; 33.3% female) were recruited; 37.0% had diabetes mellitus and 59.3% had hypertension. Brachial artery FMD increased from 4.2 +/- 1.6% (pre-TAVR) to 9.7 +/- 3.5% at early follow-up (p < 0.0001). At late follow-up, improvement compared with early follow-up was sustained (8.7 +/- 1.9%, p = 0.27). Resting brachial arterial flow velocities decreased significantly at late follow-up (11.24 +/- 5.16 vs. 7.73 +/- 2.79 cm/s, p = 0.003). Concordantly, at late follow-up, there was decrease in resting wall shear stress (WSS; 14.8 +/- 7.8 vs. 10.6 +/- 4.8dyne/cm2, p = 0.01), peak WSS (73.1 +/- 34.1 vs. 58.8 +/- 27.8dyne/cm2, p = 0.03) and cumulative WSS (3543 +/- 1852 vs. 2504 +/- 1089dyne.s/cm(2), p = 0.002). Additionally, a favourable inverse correlation between cumulative WSS and FMD was restored at late follow-up (r = -0.21 vs. r = 0.49). CONCLUSION: Endothelial function in patients with AS improves early post-TAVR and this improvement is sustained. This likely occurs as a result of improved arterial haemodynamics, leading to lower localised WSS and release of vasoactive mediators that may also alleviate myocardial ischaemia.},

   abstract = {The degree of myogenic response varies between different vascular beds and may contribute to differences in autoregulation. This study examined whether differences in pressure-induced changes in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) account for this variability by comparing responses in rabbit cerebral arteries which possess a prominent myogenic response with rat mesenteric arteries where the response is much less marked. Rat mesenteric small arteries and small branches of the posterior cerebral artery were mounted on glass pipettes in a perfusion myograph containing physiological saline at 37 degrees C and aerated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 under pressure and no flow conditions. Outer diameters of arteries were measured using a video dimension analyser. Vessel diameters were measured following exposure to 30, 60 and 90 mm Hg intralumenal distending pressure in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+ to determine the degree of active tone. In subsequent studies vessels were loaded with fura-2AM to allow measurement of changes in [Ca2+]i in response to the same conditions. Significant active tone was only seen at 60 mm Hg in rat mesenteric small arteries. In contrast, posterior cerebral arteries possessed active tone at all distending pressures. Increases in pressure were associated with rises in [Ca2+]i to similar extents in both vessel types. These data suggest that changes in [Ca2+]i in response to pressure changes in rabbit cerebral and rat mesenteric small arteries are similar despite differences in myogenic tone. The contrasting behaviour of these vessels may therefore reflect other factors such as differences sensitivity of the contractile machinery to [Ca2+]i.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the associations of time spent sedentary, in moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) and physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) with physical capability measures at age 60-64 years. METHODS: Time spent sedentary and in MVPA and, PAEE were assessed using individually calibrated combined heart rate and movement sensing among 1727 participants from the MRC National Survey of Health and Development in England, Scotland and Wales as part of a detailed clinical assessment undertaken in 2006-2010. Multivariable linear regression models were used to examine the cross-sectional associations between standardised measures of each of these behavioural variables with grip strength, chair rise and timed up-&-go (TUG) speed and standing balance time. RESULTS: Greater time spent in MVPA was associated with higher levels of physical capability; adjusted mean differences in each capability measure per 1 standard deviation increase in MVPA time were: grip strength (0.477 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.015 to 0.939), chair rise speed (0.429 stands/min, 95% CI: 0.093 to 0.764), standing balance time (0.028 s, 95% CI: 0.003 to 0.053) and TUG speed (0.019 m/s, 95% CI: 0.011 to 0.026). In contrast, time spent sedentary was associated with lower grip strength (-0.540 kg, 95% CI: -1.013 to -0.066) and TUG speed (-0.011 m/s, 95% CI: -0.019 to -0.004). Associations for PAEE were similar to those for MVPA. CONCLUSION: Higher levels of MVPA and overall physical activity (PAEE) are associated with greater levels of physical capability whereas time spent sedentary is associated with lower levels of capability. Future intervention studies in older adults should focus on both the promotion of physical activity and reduction in time spent sedentary.},

   abstract = {Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiometabolic disease, but the effect of body composition on vascular aging and arterial stiffness remains uncertain. We investigated relationships among body composition, blood pressure, age, and aortic pulse wave velocity in healthy individuals. Pulse wave velocity in the thoracic aorta, an indicator of central arterial stiffness, was measured in 221 volunteers (range, 18-72 years; mean, 40.3+/-13 years) who had no history of cardiovascular disease using cardiovascular MRI. In univariate analyses, age (r=0.78; P<0.001) and blood pressure (r=0.41; P<0.001) showed a strong positive association with pulse wave velocity. In multivariate analysis, after adjustment for age, sex, and mean arterial blood pressure, elevated body fat% was associated with reduced aortic stiffness until the age of 50 years, thereafter adiposity had an increasingly positive association with aortic stiffness (beta=0.16; P<0.001). Body fat% was positively associated with cardiac output when age, sex, height, and absolute lean mass were adjusted for (beta=0.23; P=0.002). These findings suggest that the cardiovascular system of young adults may be capable of adapting to the state of obesity and that an adverse association between body fat and aortic stiffness is only apparent in later life.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare a volume-selective three-dimensional turbo spin echo (TSE) technique with ultrasound (US) for assessing carotid artery wall structure and function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A three-dimensional volume-selective TSE technique was used to image the carotid artery in 10 healthy subjects and five hypertensive subjects (each of whom were scanned three times while they received different hypertension treatments). Lumen and wall area were measured on MR images. Two-dimensional US measurements of the intima-media thickness (IMT) and lumen diameter were taken in three orientations through a single cross section. The lumen area change over the cardiac cycle was used to determine distension. For validation, a Bland-Altman analysis was used to compare the vessel wall and lumen areas measured by three-dimensional MRI volumes with those obtained by US scans. RESULTS: Agreement between the two methods was found. The mean difference in distension between US and MRI was 1.2% (+/-5.1%). For the wall area measurements, good agreement was shown, but there was a systematic difference due to the visualization of the adventitia by MRI. Both techniques offer an easy way to objectively measure lumen indices. MRI can provide the complete circumference over the length of a vessel, while US is flexible and relatively inexpensive. The application of US is limited, however, when subjects are poorly echogenic. A difference between hypertensive and healthy subjects was found. CONCLUSION: There was a good agreement between MRI and the clinically established two-dimensional US method. The MRI method has the advantage of providing increased vessel coverage, which permits one to assess localized abnormalities without assuming vessel uniformity.},

   abstract = {In human heart failure the role of wave generation by the ventricle and wave reflection by the vasculature is contentious. The aim of this study was to compare wave generation and reflection in normal subjects with patients with stable compensated heart failure. Twenty-nine normal subjects and 67 patients with heart failure (New York Heart Association class II or III) were studied by noninvasive techniques applied to the common carotid artery. Data were analyzed by wave intensity analysis to determine the nature and direction of waves during the cardiac cycle. The energy carried by an early systolic forward compression wave (S wave) generated by the left ventricle and responsible for acceleration of flow in systole was significantly reduced in subjects with heart failure (P < 0.001), and the timing of the peak of this wave was delayed. In contrast, reflection of this wave was increased in subjects with heart failure (P < 0.001), but the timing of reflections with respect to the S wave was unchanged. The energy of an expansion wave generated by the heart in protodiastole was unaffected by heart failure. The carotid artery wave speed and the augmentation index did not significantly differ between subjects with heart failure compared with normal individuals. The ability of the left ventricle to generate a forward compression wave is markedly impaired in heart failure. Increased wave reflection serves to maintain systolic blood pressure but also places an additional load on cardiac function in heart failure.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The link between adiposity, metabolic abnormalities, and arterial disease progression in children and adolescents remains poorly defined. We aimed to assess whether persistent high adiposity levels are associated with increased arterial stiffness in adolescence and any mediation effects by common metabolic risk factors. METHODS: We included participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) who had detailed adiposity measurements between the ages 9-17 years and arterial stiffness (carotid to femoral pulse wave velocity [PWV]) measured at age 17 years. Body-mass index (BMI) and waist-to-height ratio were calculated from weight, height, and waist circumference measurements whereas fat mass was assessed using repeated dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans. We used total and trunk fat mass indices (FMIs) to classify participants as normal (<75th percentile) or high (>75th percentile) FMI. We classified participants as being metabolically unhealthy if they had three or more of the following risk factors: high levels of systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, or glucose (all >75th percentile) or low levels of high-density lipoprotein (<25th percentile). We used multivariable linear regression analysis to assess the relationship between PWV and exposure to adiposity, and tested for linear trend of PVW levels across ordinal groups. We used latent class growth mixture modelling analysis to assess the effect of longitudinal changes in adiposity indices through adolescence on arterial stiffness. FINDINGS: We studied 3423 participants (1866 [54.5%] female and 1557 [45.5%] male). Total fat mass was positively associated with PWV at age 17 years (0.004 m/s per kg, 95% CI 0.001-0.006; p=0.0081). Persistently high total FMI and trunk FMI between ages 9 and 17 years were related to greater PWV (0.15 m/s per kg/m(2), 0.05-0.24; p=0.0044 and 0.15 m/s per kg/m(2), 0.06-0.25; p=0.0021) compared with lower FMI. Metabolic abnormalities amplified the adverse effect of high total FMI on arterial stiffness (PWV 6.0 m/s [95% CI 5.9-6.0] for metabolically healthy participants and 6.2 m/s [5.9-6.4] for metabolically unhealthy participants). Participants who restored normal total FMI in adolescence (PWV 5.8 m/s [5.7-5.9] for metabolically healthy and 5.9 m/s [5.6-6.1] for metabolically unhealthy) had comparable PWV to those who had normal FMI throughout (5.7 m/s [5.7-5.8] for metabolically healthy and 5.9 m/s [5.8-5.9] for metabolically unhealthy). INTERPRETATION: Persistently high fat mass during adolescence was associated with greater arterial stiffness and was further aggravated by an unfavourable metabolic profile. Reverting to normal FMI in adolescence was associated with normal PWV, suggesting adolescence as an important period for interventions to tackle obesity in the young to maximise long-term vascular health.

   abstract = {Wave reflection is thought to be important in the augmentation of blood pressure. However, identification of distal reflections sites remains unclear. One possible explanation for this is that wave reflection is predominately determined by an amalgamation of multiple proximal small reflections rather than large discrete reflections originating from the distal peripheries. In 19 subjects (age, 35-73 years), sensor-tipped intra-arterial wires were used to measure pressure and Doppler velocity at 10-cm intervals along the aorta, starting at the aortic root. Incident and reflected waves were identified and timings and magnitudes quantified using wave intensity analysis. Mean wave speed increased along the length of the aorta (proximal, 6.8+/-0.9 m/s; distal, 10.7+/-1.5 m/s). The incident wave was tracked moving along the aorta, taking 55+/-4 ms to travel from the aortic root to the distal aorta. However, the timing to the refection site distance did not differ between proximal and distal aortic measurement sites (proximal aorta, 48+/-5 ms versus distal aorta, 42+/-4 ms; P=0.3). We performed a second analysis using aortic waveforms in a nonlinear model of pulse-wave propagation. This demonstrated very similar results to those observed in vivo and also an exponential attenuation in reflection magnitude. There is no single dominant refection site in or near the distal aorta. Rather, there are multiple reflection sites along the aorta, for which the contributions are attenuated with distance. We hypothesize that rereflection of reflected waves leads to wave entrapment, preventing distal waves being seen in the proximal aorta.},

   abstract = {The augmentation index predicts cardiovascular mortality and is usually explained as a distally reflected wave adding to the forward wave generated by systole. We propose that the capacitative properties of the aorta (the arterial reservoir) also contribute significantly to the augmentation index and have calculated the contribution of the arterial reservoir, independently of wave reflection, and assessed how these contributions change with aging. In 15 subjects (aged 53 +/- 10 yr), we measured pressure and Doppler velocity simultaneously in the proximal aorta using intra-arterial wires. We calculated the components of augmentation pressure in two ways: 1) into forward and backward (reflected) components by established separation methods, and 2) using an approach that accounts for an additional reservoir component. When the reservoir was ignored, augmentation pressure (22.7 +/- 13.9 mmHg) comprised a small forward wave (peak pressure = 6.5 +/- 9.4 mmHg) and a larger backward wave (peak pressure = 16.2 +/- 7.6 mmHg). After we took account of the reservoir, the contribution to augmentation pressure of the backward wave was reduced by 64% to 5.8 +/- 4.4 mmHg (P < 0.001), forward pressure was negligible, and reservoir pressure was the largest component (peak pressure = 19.8 +/- 9.3 mmHg). With age, reservoir pressure increased progressively (9.9 mmHg/decade, r = 0.69, P < 0.001). In conclusion, the augmentation index is principally determined by aortic reservoir function and other elastic arteries and only to a minor extent by reflected waves. Reservoir function rather than wave reflection changes markedly with aging, which accounts for the age-related changes in the aortic pressure waveform.},

   abstract = {Excess pressure integral (XSPI), a new index of surplus work performed by the left ventricle, can be calculated from blood pressure waveforms and may indicate circulatory dysfunction. We investigated whether XSPI predicted future cardiovascular events and target organ damage in treated hypertensive individuals. Radial blood pressure waveforms were acquired by tonometry in 2069 individuals (aged, 63+/-8 years) in the Conduit Artery Functional Evaluation (CAFE) substudy of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT). Measurements of left ventricular mass index (n=862) and common carotid artery intima media thickness (n=923) were also performed. XSPI and the integral of reservoir pressure were lower in people treated with amlodipine+/-perindopril than in those treated with atenolol+/-bendroflumethiazide, although brachial systolic blood pressure was similar. A total of 134 cardiovascular events accrued during a median 3.4 years of follow-up; XSPI was a significant predictor of cardiovascular events after adjustment for age and sex, and this relationship was unaffected by adjustment for conventional cardiovascular risk factors or Framingham risk score. XSPI, central systolic blood pressure, central augmentation pressure, central pulse pressure, and integral of reservoir pressure were correlated with left ventricular mass index, but only XSPI, augmentation pressure, and central pulse pressure were associated positively with carotid artery intima media thickness. Associations between left ventricular mass index, XSPI, and integral of reservoir pressure and carotid artery intima media thickness and XSPI were unaffected by multivariable adjustment for other covariates. XSPI is a novel indicator of cardiovascular dysfunction and independently predicts cardiovascular events and targets organ damage in a prospective clinical trial.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sympathetic overactivation, is reduced by renal denervation in drug-resistant hypertension. A similar role for renal denervation in heart failure remains unstudied, partly due to the concern about potential concomitant deleterious blood pressure reductions. This pilot study evaluated the safety of renal denervation for heart failure using an intensive follow-up protocol. METHOD: 7 patients (mean age 69 years) with chronic systolic heart failure (mean BP on referral 112/65 mmHg) on maximal tolerated heart failure therapy underwent bilateral renal denervation May-July 2011. Patients were admitted for pre-procedure baseline assessments and in-patient observation for 5 days following denervation. Follow-up was weekly for 4 weeks, and then monthly for 6 months. RESULTS: No significant haemodynamic disturbances were noted during the acute phase post renal denervation. Over 6 months there was a non-significant trend to blood pressure reduction (Deltasystolic -7.1 +/- 6.9 mmHg, p=0.35; Deltadiastolic -0.6 +/- 4.0 mmHg, p=0.88). No hypotensive or syncopal episodes were reported. Renal function remained stable (Deltacreatinine -5.7 +/- 8.4 mumol/l, p=0.52 and Deltaurea -1.0 +/- 1.0 mmol/l, p=0.33). All 7 patients described themselves as symptomatically improved. The six minute walk distance at six months was significantly increased (Delta=27.1 +/- 9.7 m, p=0.03), with each patient showing an increase. CONCLUSIONS: This study found no procedural or post procedural complications following renal denervation in patients with chronic systolic heart failure in 6 months of intensive follow-up. Results suggested improvements in both symptoms and exercise capacity, but further randomised, blinded sham-controlled clinical trials are required to determine the impact of renal denervation on morbidity and mortality in systolic heart failure. These data suggest such trials will be safe. ClinicalTrial.gov NCT01584700},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis causes angina despite unobstructed arteries. Measurement of conventional coronary hemodynamic parameters in patients undergoing valvular surgery has failed to explain these symptoms. With the advent of percutaneous aortic valve replacement (PAVR) and developments in coronary pulse wave analysis, it is now possible to instantaneously abolish the valvular stenosis and to measure the resulting changes in waves that direct coronary flow. METHODS AND RESULTS: Intracoronary pressure and flow velocity were measured immediately before and after PAVR in 11 patients with unobstructed coronary arteries. Using coronary pulse wave analysis, we calculated the intracoronary diastolic suction wave (the principal accelerator of coronary blood flow). To test physiological reserve to increased myocardial demand, we measured at resting heart rate and during pacing at 90 and 120 bpm. Before PAVR, the basal myocardial suction wave intensity was 1.9+/-0.3x10(-5) W . m(-2) . s(-2), and this increased in magnitude with increasing severity of aortic stenosis (r=0.59, P=0.05). This wave decreased markedly with increasing heart rate (beta coefficient=-0.16x10(-4) W . m(-2) . s(-2); P<0.001). After PAVR, despite a fall in basal suction wave (1.9+/-0.3 versus 1.1+/-0.1x10(-5) W . m(-2) . s(-2); P=0.02), there was an immediate improvement in coronary physiological reserve with increasing heart rate (beta coefficient=0.9x10(-3) W . m(-2) . s(-2); P=0.014). CONCLUSIONS: In aortic stenosis, the coronary physiological reserve is impaired. Instead of increasing when heart rate rises, the coronary diastolic suction wave decreases. Immediately after PAVR, physiological reserve returns to a normal positive pattern. This may explain how aortic stenosis can induce anginal symptoms and their prompt relief after PAVR.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coronary blood flow peaks in diastole when aortic blood pressure has fallen. Current models fail to completely explain this phenomenon. We present a new approach-using wave intensity analysis-to explain this phenomenon in normal subjects and to evaluate the effects of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). METHOD AND RESULTS: We measured simultaneous pressure and Doppler velocity with intracoronary wires in the left main stem, left anterior descending, and circumflex arteries of 20 subjects after a normal coronary arteriogram. Wave intensity analysis was used to identify and quantify individual pressure and velocity waves within the coronary artery circulation. A consistent pattern of 6 predominating waves was identified. Ninety-four percent of wave energy, accelerating blood forward along the coronary artery, came from 2 waves: first a pushing wave caused by left ventricular ejection-the dominant forward-traveling pushing wave; and later a suction wave caused by relief of myocardial microcirculatory compression-the dominant backward-traveling suction wave. The dominant backward-traveling suction wave (18.2+/-13.7 x 10(3) W m(-2)s(-1), 30%) was larger than the dominant forward-traveling pushing wave (14.3+/-17.6 x 10(3) W m(-2) s(-1), 22.3%, P =0.001) and was associated with a substantially larger increment in coronary blood flow velocity (0.51 versus 0.14 m/s, P <0.001). In LVH, the dominant backward-traveling suction wave percentage was significantly decreased (33.1% versus 26.9%, P =0.01) and inversely correlated with left ventricular septal wall thickness (r =-0.52, P <0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Six waves predominantly drive human coronary blood flow. Coronary flow peaks in diastole because of the dominance of a "suction" wave generated by myocardial microcirculatory decompression. This is significantly reduced in LVH.},

   abstract = {It has not been possible to measure wave speed in the human coronary artery, because the vessel is too short for the conventional two-point measurement technique used in the aorta. We present a new method derived from wave intensity analysis, which allows derivation of wave speed at a single point. We apply this method in the aorta and then use it to derive wave speed in the human coronary artery for the first time. We measured simultaneous pressure and Doppler velocity with intracoronary wires at the left main stem, left anterior descending and circumflex arteries, and aorta in 14 subjects after a normal coronary arteriogram. Then, in 10 subjects, serial measurements were made along the aorta before and after intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate. Wave speed was derived by two methods in the aorta: 1) the two-site distance/time method (foot-to-foot delay of pressure waveforms) and 2) a new single-point method using simultaneous pressure and velocity measurements. Coronary wave speed was derived by the single-point method. Wave speed derived by the two methods correlated well (r = 0.72, P < 0.05). Coronary wave speed correlated with aortic wave speed (r = 0.72, P = 0.002). After nitrate administration, coronary wave speed fell by 43%: from 16.4 m/s (95% confidence interval 12.6-20.1) to 9.3 m/s (95% confidence interval 6.5-12.0, P < 0.001). This single-point method allows determination of wave speed in the human coronary artery. Aortic wave speed is correlated to coronary wave speed. Finally, this technique detects the prompt fall in coronary artery wave speed with isosorbide dinitrate.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium affects 25% of older inpatients and is associated with long-term cognitive impairment and future dementia. However, no population studies have systematically ascertained cognitive function before, cognitive deficits during, and cognitive impairment after delirium. Therefore, there is a need to address the following question: does delirium, and its features (including severity, duration, and presumed aetiologies), predict long-term cognitive impairment, independent of cognitive impairment at baseline? METHODS: The Delirium and Population Health Informatics Cohort (DELPHIC) study is an observational population-based cohort study based in the London Borough of Camden. It is recruiting 2000 individuals aged >/=70 years and prospectively following them for two years, including daily ascertainment of all inpatient episodes for delirium. Daily inpatient assessments include the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale, the Observational Scale for Level of Arousal, and the Hierarchical Assessment of Balance and Mobility. Data on delirium aetiology is also collected. The primary outcome is the change in the modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status at two years. DISCUSSION: DELPHIC is the first population sample to assess older persons before, during and after hospitalisation. The cumulative incidence of delirium in the general population aged >/=70 will be described. DELPHIC offers the opportunity to quantify the impact of delirium on cognitive and functional outcomes. Overall, DELPHIC will provide a real-time public health observatory whereby information from primary, secondary, intermediate and social care can be integrated to understand how acute illness is linked to health and social care outcomes.},

   abstract = {Obtaining a "correct" view in echocardiography is a subjective process in which an operator attempts to obtain images conforming to consensus standard views. Real-time objective quantification of image alignment may assist less experienced operators, but no reliable index yet exists. We present a fully automated algorithm for detecting incorrect medial/lateral translation of an ultrasound probe by image analysis. The ability of the algorithm to distinguish optimal from sub-optimal four-chamber images was compared to that of specialists-the current "gold-standard." The orientation assessments produced by the automated algorithm correlated well with consensus visual assessments of the specialists ([Formula: see text]) and compared favourably with the correlation between individual specialists and the consensus, [Formula: see text]. Each individual specialist's assessments were within the consensus of other specialists, [Formula: see text] of the time, and the algorithm's assessments were within the consensus of specialists 85% of the time. The mean discrepancy in probe translation values between individual specialists and their consensus was [Formula: see text], and between the automated algorithm and specialists' consensus was [Formula: see text]. This technology could be incorporated into hardware to provide real-time guidance for image optimisation-a potentially valuable tool both for training and quality control.},

   abstract = {While the associations of mid-life cardiovascular risk factors with late-life white matter lesions (WMH) and cognitive decline have been established, the role of cerebral haemodynamics is unclear. We investigated the relation of late-life (69-71 years) arterial spin labelling (ASL) MRI-derived cerebral blood flow (CBF) with life-course cardiovascular risk factors (36-71 years) and late-life white matter hyperintensity (WMH) load in 282 cognitively healthy participants (52.8% female). Late-life (69-71 years) high systolic (B = -0.15) and diastolic (B = -0.25) blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure (B = -0.25) were associated with low grey matter (GM) CBF (p < 0.03), and white matter CBF (B = -0.25; B = -0.15; B = -0.13, p < 0.03, respectively). The association between systolic blood pressure and GM CBF differed between sexes (male/female B = -0.15/0.02, p = 0.04). No associations were found with early- or mid-life cardiovascular risk factors. Furthermore, WMHs were associated with cerebral haemodynamics but not cardiovascular risk factors. These findings suggest that cerebral blood flow autoregulation is able to maintain stable global cerebral haemodynamics until later in life. Future studies are encouraged to investigate why cardiovascular risk factors have differential effects on haemodynamics and WMH, and their implications for cognitive decline.},

METHODS: Myocardial tissue peak velocities were recorded at the lateral, septal, posterior, and inferior angles of the mitral annulus as well as at the lateral tricuspid annulus by pulsed-wave tissue Doppler echocardiography before PCI, as well as 1 day and 6 weeks after intervention. RESULTS: Twenty-four consecutive patients with chronic stable angina and preserved systolic left ventricular function (20 men; mean age, 64 +/- 9 years) undergoing PCI were studied. Compared with preinterventional values, early diastolic velocities improved at all sites (P < .05 for each). The most pronounced improvement occurred in the septal area. Similarly, systolic peak velocity improved in the septal, lateral, inferior, and right ventricular areas (P < .04 for each). CONCLUSIONS: Tissue Doppler parameters of diastolic and systolic function improve early after successful PCI, and this effect persists to 6 weeks after intervention.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increased platelet activation occurs in ischemic heart disease (IHD), but increased platelet activation is also seen in cerebrovascular atherosclerosis and peripheral artery disease. It is not clear therefore whether platelet activation is an indicator of IHD or a marker of generalized atherosclerosis and inflammation. South Asian subjects are at high risk of IHD, but little is known regarding differences in platelet and leukocyte function between European and South Asian subjects. METHODS: Fifty-four male subjects (age 49-79 years) had coronary artery calcification measured by multislice computed tomography (CT), aortic atherosclerosis assessed by measurement of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (aortic PWV), and femoral and carotid atherosclerosis measured by B-mode ultrasound. Platelet and leukocyte activation was assessed by flow cytometry of platelet-monocyte complexes (PMC), platelet expression of PAC-1 binding site and CD62P, and expression of L-selectin on leukocytes. RESULTS: Elevated circulating PMC correlated significantly with elevated aortic PWV and PMC were higher in subjects with femoral plaques. In contrast PMC did not differ by increasing coronary artery calcification category or presence of carotid plaques. Higher numbers of PMC were independently related to elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), higher aortic PWV, hypertension and smoking in a multivariate model. Markers of platelet and leukocyte activation did not differ significantly by ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: Increased PMC are related to the extent of aortic and femoral atherosclerosis rather than coronary or carotid atherosclerosis. The association between elevated CRP and increased PMC suggests that inflammation in relation to generalized atherosclerosis may play an important role in PMC activation.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the potential of MRI to investigate the mechanical effects of compression stockings on the veins of the lower limb. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The right calves of eight healthy volunteers were imaged in the prone position, with and without the presence of a compression stocking. Cross-sectional areas of all peroneal and posterior tibial veins, both saphenous veins, and any sufficiently large superficial veins were segmented in all subjects at mid-calf level in both cases. Variation in cross-sectional area along the axis of the great saphenous vein and a peroneal vein was also examined in three subjects. RESULTS: The mean cross-sectional area reduction was found to be greater in the deep veins (64%) than in the superficial veins (39%). Deep-vein cross-sections were generally elliptical, while superficial veins were approximately circular. Significant axial fluctuations were found in the cross-sectional areas. CONCLUSION: MRI offers a precise source of data on the mechanical effects of lower-limb compression. Ultrasound (US) may be more cost-effective, but the data acquired are less comprehensive. Future biomechanical studies of lower-limb compression should make use of MRI.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this study was to estimate wall shear stress (WSS) in individual vessels of the venous circulation of the calf and quantify the effects of elastic compression based on change of vessel geometry and velocity waveform. The great saphenous vein and either a peroneal or posterior tibial vein have been imaged in four healthy subjects using magnetic resonance imaging, with and without the presence of a grade 1 medical stocking. Flow through image-based reconstructed geometries was numerically simulated for both a range of steady flow rates and ultrasound-derived transient velocity waveforms, scaled to give a standardized time averaged flow rate. For steady flow, the stocking produced an average percentage increase in mean WSS of approximately 100% in the great saphenous vein across a range of 0.125-1.25 ml/s. The percentage increase in the peroneal/posterior tibial veins varied from 490 to 650% across a range of 0.5-5 ml/s. In addition, application of the stocking eliminated periods of very low or zero flow from the transient waveforms. The average minimum value of WSS in all vessels without the stocking was <0.1 Pa. With the stocking, this was increased to 0.7 Pa in the great saphenous and 0.9 Pa in the peroneal/posterior tibial veins. The pathophysiological effects of these changes are discussed. In conclusion, the flight stocking was effective in raising venous WSS levels in prone subjects, and this effect was much more pronounced in the deep vessels. The stocking also tended to prevent cessation of flow during periods of increased downstream pressure produced by respiration.},

   abstract = {Aims: Marathon running is a popular ambition in modern societies inclusive of non-athletes. Previous studies have highlighted concerning transient myocardial dysfunction and biomarker release immediately after the race. Whether this method of increasing physical activity is beneficial or harmful remains a matter of debate. We examine in detail the real-world cardiovascular remodeling response following competition in a first marathon. Methods: Sixty-eight novice marathon runners (36 men and 32 women) aged 30 +/- 3 years were investigated 6 months before and 2 weeks after the 2016 London Marathon race in a prospective observational study. Evaluation included electrocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, echocardiography, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Results: After 17 weeks unsupervised marathon training, runners revealed a symmetrical, eccentric remodeling response with 3-5% increases in left and right ventricular cavity sizes, respectively. Blood pressure (BP) fell by 4/2 mmHg (P < 0.01) with reduction in arterial stiffness, despite only 11% demonstrating a clinically meaningful improvement in peak oxygen consumption with an overall non-significant 0.4 ml/min/kg increase in peak oxygen consumption (P = 0.14). Conclusion: In the absence of supervised training, exercise-induced cardiovascular remodeling in real-world novice marathon runners is more modest than previously described and occurs even without improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness. The responses are similar in men and women, who experience a beneficial BP reduction and no evidence of myocardial fibrosis or persistent edema, when achieving average finishing times.},

We examine whether this stimulus can produce exercise-induced left ventricular (LV) trabeculation. METHODS: Sixty-eight novice marathon runners aged 29.5 +/- 3.2 years had indices of LV trabeculation measured by echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging 6 months before and 2 weeks after the 2016 London Marathon race, in a prospective longitudinal study. RESULTS: After 17 weeks unsupervised marathon training, indices of LV trabeculation were essentially unchanged. Despite satisfactory inter-observer agreement in most methods of trabeculation measurement, criteria defining abnormally hypertrabeculated cases were discordant with each other. LV hypertrabeculation was a frequent finding in young, healthy individuals with no subject demonstrating clear evidence of a cardiomyopathy. CONCLUSION: Training for a first marathon does not induce LV trabeculation. It remains unclear whether prolonged, high-dose exercise can create de novo trabeculation or expose concealed trabeculation. Applying cut off values from published LV noncompaction cardiomyopathy criteria to young, healthy individuals risks over-diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence is limited on ethnic differences in associations between kidney function markers and mortality or cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: Baseline cross-sectional analysis and longitudinal follow-up study of a UK population-based cohort of 1,116 Europeans and 1,104 South Asians of predominantly Indian descent, age 52 +/- 7 years at baseline (1988-1991). Kidney function was estimated using Cystatin C and creatinine-based chronic kidney disease (CKD) Epidemiology Collaboration estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) equations, and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR). Mortality was captured at 27 years, and incident CVD at 22 years, from death certification, medical records and participant report. Longitudinal associations between eGFR/ACR and mortality/incident CVD were examined using Cox models. RESULTS: eGFRcys was lower and ACR higher in South Asians than Europeans. eGFRcys and -eGFRcreat were more strongly associated with outcomes in Europeans than South Asians. Conversely, associations between ACR and outcomes were greater in South Asians than Europeans, for example, for CVD mortality: HRs (95% CI) adjusted for CVD risk factors and ACR/eGFRcys as appropriate, p for ethnicity interaction: eGFRcys: Europeans: 0.76 (0.62-0.92), South Asians: 0.92 (0.78-1.07), p = 0.05, eGFRcreat: Europeans 0.81 (0.67-0.99), South Asians 1.18 (0.97-1.41), p = 0.002, ACR: -Europeans: 1.24 (1.08-1.42), South Asians: 1.39 (1.25-1.57), p= 0.23. Addition of all CKD measures to a standard CVD risk factor model modestly improved prediction capability in -Europeans; in South Asians only ACR contributed to improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Strong associations between ACR and outcomes in South Asians of predominantly Indian origin, and null associations for eGFRcys and eGFRcreat, suggest that ACR may have greater utility in CVD risk prediction in South Asians. Further work is needed to validate these -findings.},

We report findings from a UK cohort study of 1375 European and 1074 South Asian men, not receiving antihypertensive medication, aged 40 to 69 years at baseline (1988-1991). Assessment included BP, blood tests, anthropometry, and questionnaires. Incident stroke was established at 20 years from death certification, hospital and primary care records, and participant report. South Asians had higher systolic BP, diastolic BP, and mean arterial pressure than Europeans, and similar pulse pressure. Associations between systolic BP or diastolic BP and stroke were stronger in South Asians than Europeans, after adjustment for age, smoking status, waist/hip ratio, total/high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratio, diabetes mellitus, fasting glucose, physical activity, and heart rate (systolic BP: Europeans [odds ratio, 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-1.51], South Asians [1.56; 1.24-1.95]; ethnic difference P=0.04; diastolic BP: Europeans [0.90; 0.71-1.13], South Asians [1.68; 1.32-2.15]; P<0.001). Hemodynamic correlates of stroke risk differed by ethnicity: in combined models, mean arterial pressure but not pulse pressure was detrimentally associated with stroke in South Asians, whereas the converse was true for Europeans. The combination of hyperglycemia and hypertension appeared particularly detrimental for South Asians. There are marked ethnic differences in associations between BP parameters and stroke. Undue focus on systolic BP for risk prediction, and current age and treatment thresholds may be inappropriate for individuals of South Asian ancestry.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine ethnic differences in ectopic fat and associations with incident diabetes. METHODS: In a UK cohort study, 1338 Europeans, 838 South Asians, and 330 African Caribbeans living in London were aged 40-69 years at baseline. Baseline assessment included blood tests, anthropometry, and questionnaires. Anthropometry-based prediction equations estimated baseline visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Incident diabetes was ascertained from record review, self-report, or oral glucose tolerance testing. RESULTS: South Asians had more and African Caribbeans less estimated VAT than Europeans. Both ethnic minorities had larger truncal skinfolds than Europeans. In men, adjustment for risk factors (BMI, smoking, systolic blood pressure, and HDL-cholesterol) markedly attenuated the association between estimated VAT and diabetes in Europeans (standardized subhazard ratios [95% CI]: from 1.74 [1.49, 2.03] to 1.16 [0.77, 1.76]) and African Caribbeans (1.72 [1.26, 2.35] to 1.44 [0.69, 3.02]) but not South Asians (1.60 [1.38, 1.86] to 1.90 [1.37, 2.64]). In women, attenuation was observed only for South Asians (1.80 [1.01, 3.23] to 1.07 [0.49, 2.31]). Associations between truncal skinfolds and diabetes appeared less affected by multivariable adjustment in South Asians and African Caribbeans than Europeans (1.24 [0.97, 1.57] and 1.28 [0.89, 1.82] versus 1.02 [0.77, 1.36] in men; 1.91 [1.03, 3.56] and 1.42 [0.86, 2.34] versus 1.23 [0.74, 2.05] in women). CONCLUSIONS: Differences in overall truncal fat, as well as VAT, may contribute to the excess of diabetes in South Asian and African Caribbean groups, particularly for women.},

   abstract = {AIMS: We contrasted impaired glucose regulation (prediabetes) prevalence, defined according to oral glucose tolerance test or HbA1c values, and studied cross-sectional associations between prediabetes and subclinical/clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a cohort of European and South Asian origin. METHODS: For 682 European and 520 South Asian men and women, aged 58-85 years, glycaemic status was determined by oral glucose tolerance test or HbA1c thresholds. Questionnaires, record review, coronary artery calcification scores and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging established clinical plus subclinical coronary heart and cerebrovascular disease. RESULTS: Prediabetes was more prevalent in South Asian participants when defined by HbA1c rather than by oral glucose tolerance test criteria. Accounting for age, sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides and waist-hip ratio, prediabetes was associated with coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease in European participants, most obviously when defined by HbA1c rather than by oral glucose tolerance test [odds ratios for HbA1c -defined prediabetes 1.60 (95% CI 1.07, 2.39) for coronary heart disease and 1.57 (95% CI 1.00, 2.51) for cerebrovascular disease]. By contrast, non-significant associations were present between oral glucose tolerance test-defined prediabetes only and coronary heart disease [odds ratio 1.41 (95% CI 0.84, 2.36)] and HbA1c -defined prediabetes only and cerebrovascular disease [odds ratio 1.39 (95% CI 0.69, 2.78)] in South Asian participants. Prediabetes defined by HbA1c or oral glucose tolerance test criteria was associated with cardiovascular disease (defined as coronary heart and/or cerebrovascular disease) in Europeans [odds ratio 1.95 (95% CI 1.31, 2.91) for HbA1c prediabetes criteria] but not in South Asian participants [odds ratio 1.00 (95% CI 0.62, 2.66); ethnicity interaction P = 0.04]. CONCLUSIONS: Prediabetes appeared to be less associated with cardiovascular disease in the South Asian than in the European group. These findings have implications for screening, and early cardiovascular prevention strategies in South Asian populations.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We examined longitudinal associations between prediabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (coronary heart disease [CHD] and stroke) in Europeans and South Asians. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a U.K. cohort study of 1,336 Europeans and 1,139 South Asians, aged 40-69 years at baseline (1988-1991). Assessment included blood pressure, blood tests, anthropometry, and questionnaires. Prediabetes was determined by OGTT or HbA1c, using either International Expert Committee (IEC) (HbA1c 6.0-6.5% [42-48 mmol/mol]) or American Diabetes Association (ADA) (HbA1c 5.7-6.5% [39-48 mmol/mol]) cut points. Incident CHD and stroke were established at 20 years from death certification, hospital admission, primary care record review, and participant report. RESULTS: Compared with normoglycemic individuals, IEC-defined prediabetes was related to both CHD and CVD risk in Europeans but not South Asians (subhazard ratio for CHD 1.68 [95% CI 1.19, 2.38] vs. 1.00 [0.75, 1.33], ethnicity interaction P = 0.008, and for CVD 1.49 [1.08, 2.07] vs. 1.03 [0.78, 1.36], ethnicity interaction P = 0.04). Conversely, IEC-defined prediabetes was associated with stroke risk in South Asians but not Europeans (1.73 [1.03, 2.90] vs. 0.85 [0.44, 1.64], ethnicity interaction P = 0.11). Risks were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio, waist-to-hip ratio, systolic blood pressure, and antihypertensive use. Associations were weaker for OGTT or ADA-defined prediabetes. Conversion from prediabetes to diabetes was greater in South Asians, but accounting for time to conversion did not account for these ethnic differences. CONCLUSIONS: Associations between prediabetes and CVD differed by prediabetes diagnostic criterion, type of CVD, and ethnicity, with associations being present for overall CVD in Europeans but not South Asians. Substantiation of these findings and investigation of potential explanations are required.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: South Asians and African Caribbeans experience more cardiometabolic disease than Europeans. Risk factors include visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous abdominal (SAT) adipose tissue, which vary with ethnicity and are difficult to quantify using anthropometry. OBJECTIVE: We developed and cross-validated ethnicity and gender-specific equations using anthropometrics to predict VAT and SAT. DESIGN: 669 Europeans, 514 South Asians and 227 African Caribbeans (70 +/- 7 years) underwent anthropometric measurement and abdominal CT scanning. South Asian and African Caribbean participants were first-generation migrants living in London. Prediction equations were derived for CT-measured VAT and SAT using stepwise regression, then cross-validated by comparing actual and predicted means. RESULTS: South Asians had more and African Caribbeans less VAT than Europeans. For basic VAT prediction equations (age and waist circumference), model fit was better in men (R(2) range 0.59-0.71) than women (range 0.35-0.59). Expanded equations (+ weight, height, hip and thigh circumference) improved fit for South Asian and African Caribbean women (R(2) 0.35 to 0.55, and 0.43 to 0.56 respectively). For basic SAT equations, R(2) was 0.69-0.77, and for expanded equations it was 0.72-0.86. Cross-validation showed differences between actual and estimated VAT of <7%, and SAT of <8% in all groups, apart from VAT in South Asian women which disagreed by 16%. CONCLUSION: We provide ethnicity- and gender-specific VAT and SAT prediction equations, derived from a large tri-ethnic sample. Model fit was reasonable for SAT and VAT in men, while basic VAT models should be used cautiously in South Asian and African Caribbean women. These equations will aid studies of mechanisms of cardiometabolic disease in later life, where imaging data are not available.},

METHODS: Five hundred and fourteen South Asians and 669 Europeans, aged 56-86. Questionnaires, record review, blood testing, and coronary artery calcification scores provided diabetes and clinical plus subclinical coronary heart disease (CHD) diagnoses. Abdominal visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue, thigh subcutaneous adipose tissue (TSAT), intermuscular and intramuscular thigh fat and thigh muscle were measured by CT. RESULTS: Accounting for body size, South Asians had greater VAT and TSAT than Europeans, but less thigh muscle. Associations between depots and disease were stronger in South Asians than Europeans. In multivariable analyses in South Asians, VAT was positively associated with diabetes and CHD, while TSAT and thigh muscle were protective for diabetes, and thigh muscle for CHD. Differences in VAT and thigh muscle only partially explained the excess diabetes and CHD in South Asians versus Europeans. Insulin resistance did not account for the effects of TSAT or thigh muscle. CONCLUSIONS: Greater VAT and TSAT and lesser thigh muscle in South Asians contributed to ethnic differences in cardiometabolic disease. Effects of TSAT and thigh muscle were independent of insulin resistance.},

   abstract = {Ethnic differences in non-communicable disease risk have been described between individuals of South Asian and European ethnicity that are only partially explained by genetics and other known risk factors. DNA methylation is one underexplored mechanism that may explain differences in disease risk. Currently, there is little knowledge of how DNA methylation varies between South Asian and European ethnicities. This study characterised differences in blood DNA methylation between individuals of self-reported European and South Asian ethnicity from two UK-based cohorts: Southall and Brent Revisited and Born in Bradford. DNA methylation differences between ethnicities were widespread throughout the genome (n = 16,433 CpG sites, 3.4% sites tested). Specifically, 76% of associations were attributable to ethnic differences in cell composition with fewer effects attributable to smoking and genetic variation. Ethnicity-associated CpG sites were enriched for EWAS Catalog phenotypes including metabolites. This work highlights the need to consider ethnic diversity in epigenetic research.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: DNA methylation is strongly associated with smoking status at multiple sites across the genome. Studies have largely been restricted to European origin individuals yet the greatest increase in smoking is occurring in low income countries, such as the Indian subcontinent. We determined whether there are differences between South Asians and Europeans in smoking related loci, and if a smoking score, combining all smoking related DNA methylation scores, could differentiate smokers from non-smokers. RESULTS: Illumina HM450k BeadChip arrays were performed on 192 samples from the Southall And Brent REvisited (SABRE) cohort. Differential methylation in smokers was identified in 29 individual CpG sites at 18 unique loci. Interaction between smoking status and ethnic group was identified at the AHRR locus. Ethnic differences in DNA methylation were identified in non-smokers at two further loci, 6p21.33 and GNG12. With the exception of GFI1 and MYO1G these differences were largely unaffected by adjustment for cell composition. A smoking score based on methylation profile was constructed. Current smokers were identified with 100% sensitivity and 97% specificity in Europeans and with 80% sensitivity and 95% specificity in South Asians. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in ethnic groups were identified in both single CpG sites and combined smoking score. The smoking score is a valuable tool for identification of true current smoking behaviour. Explanations for ethnic differences in DNA methylation in association with smoking may provide valuable clues to disease pathways.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is consistent evidence on the impact of health behaviours on risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in European populations. As South Asians in the UK have an excess risk of CVD and coronary heart disease (CHD) compared to Europeans, we investigated whether a similar association between combined health behaviours and risk of CVD and CHD among this high-risk group exists, and estimated the population impact. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In a prospective cohort of 1090 Europeans and 1006 South Asians (40-69 y) without prevalent CVD at baseline (1988-1990), followed up for 21 years to 2011, there were 601 incident CVD events [Europeans n = 255; South Asians n = 346] of which 520 were CHD events [n = 207 and 313 respectively]. Participants scored between 0 to 4 points for a composite score including four baseline healthy behaviours (non-smoker, moderate alcohol intake, physically active, frequent fruit/vegetable intake). Adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for incident CHD in Europeans who had three, two, one, and zero compared to four health behaviours were 1.33 (0.78-2.29), 1.96 (1.15-3.33), 1.36 (0.74-2.48) and 2.45 (1.18-5.10), respectively, p-trend = 0.025. In South Asians, corresponding HRs were 2.88 (1.33-6.24), 2.28 (1.06-4.91), 3.36 (1.53-7.39) and 3.48 (1.38-8.81), p-trend = 0.022. The results were similar for incident CVD; Europeans HR 2.12 (1.14-3.94), p-trend = 0.014; South Asians HR 2.73 (1.20-6.21), p-trend = 0.018. The population attributable fraction in Europeans was 43% for CHD and 28% for CVD. In South Asians it was 63% and 51% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of adherence to four combined health behaviours was associated with 2 to 3-fold increased risk of incident CVD in Europeans and South Asians. A substantial population impact in the South Asian group indicates important potential for disease prevention in this high-risk group by adherence to healthy behaviours.},

We studied risks and determinants of type 2 diabetes in first- and second-generation (born in the UK) migrants, and in those of mixed ethnicity. METHODS: Data from the UK Biobank, a population-based cohort of ~500,000 participants aged 40-69 at recruitment, were used. Type 2 diabetes was assigned using self-report and HbA1c. Ethnicity was both self-reported and genetically assigned using admixture level scores. European, mixed European/South Asian (MixESA), mixed European/African Caribbean (MixEAC), SA and AC groups were analysed, matched for age and sex to enable comparison. In the frames of this cross-sectional study, we compared type 2 diabetes in second- vs first-generation migrants, and mixed ethnicity vs non-mixed groups. Risks and explanations were analysed using logistic regression and mediation analysis, respectively. RESULTS: Type 2 diabetes prevalence was markedly elevated in SA (599/3317 = 18%) and AC (534/4180 = 13%) compared with Europeans (140/3324 = 4%). Prevalence was lower in second- vs first-generation SA (124/1115 = 11% vs 155/1115 = 14%) and AC (163/2200 = 7% vs 227/2200 = 10%). Favourable adiposity (i.e. lower waist/hip ratio or BMI) contributed to lower risk in second-generation migrants. Type 2 diabetes in mixed populations (MixESA: 52/831 = 6%, MixEAC: 70/1045 = 7%) was lower than in comparator ethnic groups (SA: 18%, AC: 13%) and higher than in Europeans (4%). Greater socioeconomic deprivation accounted for 17% and 42% of the excess type 2 diabetes risk in MixESA and MixEAC compared with Europeans, respectively. Replacing self-reported with genetically assigned ethnicity corroborated the mixed ethnicity analysis. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Type 2 diabetes risks in second-generation SA and AC migrants are a fifth lower than in first-generation migrants. Mixed ethnicity risks were markedly lower than SA and AC groups, though remaining higher than in Europeans. Distribution of environmental risk factors, largely obesity and socioeconomic status, appears to play a key role in accounting for ethnic differences in type 2 diabetes risk.},

Timing and magnitude of the decline in MVPA in children and adolescents are unclear but important for informing effective obesity intervention development. This systematic review aimed to determine and compare the year-to-year changes in MVPA among children and adolescents. Longitudinal studies were identified by searching 10 relevant databases up to December 2018. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported accelerometer-assessed MVPA (min day(-1) ) separately for boys and girls and had follow-up duration of at least 1 year. After screening 9,232 studies, 52 were included representing 22,091 aged 3 to 18 year olds (boys=8,857; girls=13,234). Pooled-analysis of the relative change in MVPA per year showed a decline of -3.4% (95% CI, -5.9 to -0.9) in boys and -5.3% (95% CI, -7.6 to -3.1) in girls, across all age groups. There were notable declines in MVPA at age 9 for both boys (-7.8%, 95% CI, -11.2 to -4.4) and girls (-10.2%, 95% CI, -14.2 to -6.3). The relative decline in MVPA affects both sexes from an early age; however, it is greater among girls. Interventions to promote MVPA should start before adolescence.},

We investigated whether glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measured at ages of 53, 60-64 and 69 years, and cumulative glycemic index (CGI), a measure of cumulative glycemic burden, were associated with metrics of brain health in later life. Participants were from Insight 46, a substudy of the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) who undertook volumetric MRI, florbetapir amyloid-PET imaging and cognitive assessments at ages of 69-71. Analyses were performed using linear and logistic regression as appropriate, with adjustment for potential confounders. We observed a sex interaction between HbA1c and whole brain volume (WBV) at all 3 time points. Following stratification of our sample, we observed that HbA1c at all ages, and CGI were positively associated with lower WBV exclusively in females. HbA1c (or CGI) was not associated with amyloid status, white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), hippocampal volumes (HV) or cognitive outcomes in either sex. Higher HbA1c in adulthood is associated with smaller WBV at 69-71 years in females but not in males. This suggests that there may be preferential target organ damage in the brain for females with hyperglycemia.},

In women, higher fasting glucose and insulin resistance at age approximately 60 were weakly associated with lower WBV at age approximately 70 [eg, fasting glucose: beta* = -0.07 (95% CI: -0.13, -0.01), P = .02]. No associations emerged for men for any glycaemic marker. HOMA-%B was not associated with brain outcomes in either sex. Women's later-life brain health may be more vulnerable to midlife hyperglycaemia.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inadequate treatment of hypertension is a widespread problem, especially in South Asian countries where cardiovascular disease mortality rates are high. We aimed to explore the effect of a multicomponent intervention (MCI) on antihypertensive medication intensification among rural South Asians with hypertension. METHODS: A post hoc analysis of a 2-year cluster-randomized controlled trial including 2,645 hypertensives aged >/=40 years from 30 rural communities, 10 each, in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Independent assessors collected information on participants' self-reports and physical inspection of medications. The main outcomes were the changes from baseline to 24 months in the following: (i) the therapeutic intensity score (TIS) for all (and class-specific) antihypertensive medications; (ii) the number of antihypertensive medications in all trial participants. RESULTS: At 24 months, the mean increase in the TIS score of all antihypertensive medications was 0.11 in the MCI group and 0.03 in the control group, with a between-group difference in the increase of 0.08 (95% confidence interval (CI, 0.03, 0.12); P = 0.002). In MCI compared with controls, a greater increase in the TIS of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers (0.05; 95% CI (0.02, 0.07); P < 0.001) and calcium channel blockers (0.03; 95% CI (0.00, 0.05); P = 0.031), and in the number of antihypertensive medications (0.11, 95% CI (0.02, 0.19); P = 0.016) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: In rural communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, MCI led to a greater increase in antihypertensive medication intensification compared with the usual care among adults with hypertension.

   abstract = {The cardiovascular risk reduction associated with different statins for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and the cardiovascular risk increase associated with excess dietary intake of fat have been quantified. However, these relative risks have never been directly juxtaposed to determine whether an increase in relative risk by 1 activity could be neutralized by an opposing change in relative risk from a second activity. The investigators compared the increase in relative risk for cardiovascular disease associated with the total fat and trans fat content of fast foods against the relative risk decrease provided by daily statin consumption from a meta-analysis of statins in primary prevention of coronary artery disease (7 randomized controlled trials including 42,848 patients). The risk reduction associated with the daily consumption of most statins, with the exception of pravastatin, is more powerful than the risk increase caused by the daily extra fat intake associated with a 7-oz hamburger (Quarter Pounder) with cheese and a small milkshake. In conclusion, statin therapy can neutralize the cardiovascular risk caused by harmful diet choices. In other spheres of human activity, individuals choosing risky pursuits (motorcycling, smoking, driving) are advised or compelled to use measures to minimize the risk (safety equipment, filters, seatbelts). Likewise, some individuals eat unhealthily. Routine accessibility of statins in establishments providing unhealthy food might be a rational modern means to offset the cardiovascular risk. Fast food outlets already offer free condiments to supplement meals. A free statin-containing accompaniment would offer cardiovascular benefits, opposite to the effects of equally available salt, sugar, and high-fat condiments. Although no substitute for systematic lifestyle improvements, including healthy diet, regular exercise, weight loss, and smoking cessation, complimentary statin packets would add, at little cost, 1 positive choice to a panoply of negative ones.},

   abstract = {Current in vivo models of arterial lesions often lead to unpredictable results in terms of lesion anatomy and hemodynamical significance. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of coronary stenosis using a novel in vivo adjustable stenosis model capable of mimicking advanced human coronary lesions. We developed a series of balloon expandable covered coronary stents with a central restriction, mimicking different intermediate to severe stenosis, and implanted them percutaneously in coronary arteries of eight healthy hybrid Landrace pigs. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) pullbacks and fractional flow reserve (FFR) were acquired along the artery after implantation of the stenotic stents for precise evaluation of anatomy and functional impact. Diameter and area stenosis after deployment of the stenosis implant were, on average, respectively, 54.1 +/- 5.9 and 78.4 +/- 5.8 % and average FFR value was 0.83 (SD 0.13). There was a low correlation between FFR and MLA evaluated by OCT (r = 0.02, p = 0.94), improved with percentage area stenosis (r = -0.55, p = 0.12), or OCT volumetric evaluation of the stenosis taking into account not only the MLA but also the length of the lesion (r = -0.78, p = 0.01). This study presents a method and proof of concept for percutaneously introducing, and removing, anatomical stenosis of predetermined severity in vivo. Such in vivo model may be used to create and evaluate the impact of focal stenoses on physiological parameters such as FFR.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Hypertension management is directed by cuff blood pressure (BP), but this may be inaccurate, potentially influencing cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and health costs. This study aimed to determine the impact on CVD events and related costs of the differences between cuff and invasive SBP. METHODS: Microsimulations based on Markov modelling over one year were used to determine the differences in the number of CVD events (myocardial infarction or coronary death, stroke, atrial fibrillation or heart failure) predicted by Framingham risk and total CVD health costs based on cuff SBP compared with invasive (aortic) SBP. Modelling was based on international consortium data from 1678 participants undergoing cardiac catheterization and 30 separate studies. Cuff underestimation and overestimation were defined as cuff SBP less than invasive SBP and cuff SBP greater than invasive SBP, respectively. RESULTS: The proportion of people with cuff SBP underestimation versus overestimation progressively increased as SBP increased. This reached a maximum ratio of 16 : 1 in people with hypertension grades II and III. Both the number of CVD events missed (predominantly stroke, coronary death and myocardial infarction) and associated health costs increased stepwise across levels of SBP control, as cuff SBP underestimation increased. The maximum number of CVD events potentially missed (11.8/1000 patients) and highest costs ($241 300 USD/1000 patients) were seen in people with hypertension grades II and III and with at least 15 mmHg of cuff SBP underestimation. CONCLUSION: Cuff SBP underestimation can result in potentially preventable CVD events being missed and major increases in health costs. These issues could be remedied with improved cuff SBP accuracy.},

The variation of vessel diameter in the direction of vessel longitude axis has been described by a tracking technique based on parameters of modelled intensity distribution curves over every cross section.

Neither heparin nor ruthenium red significantly inhibited peak contractile responses to K+, noradrenaline or caffeine in physiological saline, although heparin significantly increased the time taken for peak force to develop in response to noradrenaline. Noradrenaline and calcium concentration-response relationships were unaffected by heparin. Experiments with permeabilised, fura-2 loaded vessels indicated that heparin inhibited Ca2+ release induced by noradrenaline, but did not inhibit caffeine-induced Ca2+ release. The peak rise in intracellular Ca2+ following K+, or noradrenaline in physiological saline was unaffected by heparin. The use of reversible permeabilisation may prove a useful approach, allowing introduction of a variety of membrane-impermeant blockers of second messenger systems into intact resistance arteries.},

Noradrenaline and calcium concentration-response relationships were unaffected by heparin. Experiments with permeabilised, fura-2 loaded vessels indicated that heparin inhibited Ca2+ release induced by noradrenaline, but did not inhibit caffeine-induced Ca2+ release. The peak rise in intracellular Ca2+ following K+, or noradrenaline in physiological saline was unaffected by heparin. The use of reversible permeabilisation may prove a useful approach, allowing introduction of a variety of membrane-impermeant blockers of second messenger systems into intact resistance arteries.},

   abstract = {We examined the effects of ryanodine and thapsigargin on changes in cytoplasmic [Ca2+] (Cai) and muscle tension in rat mesenteric resistance arteries induced by norepinephrine (NE) and caffeine. Both ryanodine and thapsigargin markedly inhibited the increase in Cai and contractile responses to caffeine in physiological saline and to NE and caffeine in calcium-free conditions. In contrast, peak responses to potassium depolarisation and NE in physiological saline appeared little affected, although time taken to achieve 50% of peak response after addition of NE was slowed after ryanodine and thapsigargin treatment. Neither ryanodine nor thapsigargin altered resting tone or Cai or the Ca2+ sensitivity of contraction under depolarized conditions. The NE concentration-response relationship was not significantly altered after ryanodine or thapsigargin. Ryanodine and thapsigargin inhibit the release of intracellular Ca2+ stores by NE and caffeine. Inhibition of release of intracellular Ca2+ by NE has only slight effects on contractile responses of mesenteric resistance arteries when extracellular Ca2+ is present.},

Rat mesenteric (approximately 250 microns) were set up in a single-channel isometric myograph designed to allow with 6 microM fura-2AM for 2 h and simultaneous recordings of neurogenic contraction (force) and intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i were obtained. In other experiments, arteries were loaded with 1 microCi ml-1 [3H]-noradrenaline (NA) for 30 min in order to measure release of [3H]-NA in response to field stimulation to examine whether ryanodine directly inhibited neuronal release of NA. 2. Arteries were activated by single intermittent field stimulation or continuously to excite intrinsic sympathetic nerves, or by cumulative addition of noradrenaline (1 nM-10 microM) to the bathing solution. 3. Pre-incubation with ryanodine markedly inhibited the contraction and [Ca2+]i release in response to single-pulse nerve stimulation. Ryanodine also inhibited an early phasic component of the response to continuous field stimulation and reduced the rate of rise in force in response to continuous field stimulation. However, stable maximal contraction and [Ca2+]i in response to continuous field stimulation as well as maximal responses to exogenous NA were unaffected. Release of [3H]-NA in response to single intermittent field stimulation was not affected by ryanodine when compared to vehicle. 4. Our results suggest that brief intermittent activation of intramural sympathetic nerves increases [Ca2+]i and contracts small arteries primarily by releasing Ca2+ from a ryanodine-sensitive intracellular store. In contrast, the stable rise in tone and [Ca2+]i resulting from continuous nerve stimulation may largely depend on sources of Ca2+ other than the ryanodine-sensitive intracellular store.},

   abstract = {Natriuretic peptides play an important role in sodium regulation and blood pressure (BP) control. We examined the effects of atrial natriuetic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) on human isolated resistance arteries and the mechanisms involved in vasorelaxation. Human subcutaneous resistance arteries were mounted in an isometric myograph and contracted with phenylephrine. CNP, but not ANP or BNP, relaxed arteries in a concentration dependent manner. The action of CNP was unaffected by removal of the endothelium, inhibition of nitric oxide synthase by NG-monomethyl-Larginine or inhibition of soluble guanylate cyclase by 1H-[1,2,4] oxadiazolo [4,3-alpha] quinoxalin-1-one. Blockade of cyclic GMPdependent kinase by 8- bromoguanosine- 3, 5- cyclic monophosphorothioate, Rp-isomer (Rp-8-Br-cGMPS) inhibited CNP relaxation. CNP relaxation was also inhibited by high potassium or iberiotoxin, indicating that it was due to opening of BKCa channels. Omapatrilat, a vasopeptidase inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase and angiotensin-converting enzyme, enhanced the effect of CNP and inhibited responses to Ang I. In summary, CNP, but not ANP or BNP, relaxes human resistance arteries by activating cyclic GMP-dependent kinase and BKCa. The effects of CNP are enhanced by vasopeptidase inhibition and this may contribute to the vasodilator effects of these agents in vivo. Since CNP is widely present in endothelium it may play a role in the regulation of peripheral resistance in man in physiological and pathological circumstances.},

   abstract = {The effect of amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist which is largely ionized at physiological pH, was studied in human resistance arteries. Resistance arteries were isolated from subcutaneous fat and isometric force measured in a myograph. Amlodipine inhibited depolarization-induced contractions in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The potency of amlodipine was markedly increased by depolarization of the resistance arteries by a physiological saline containing high potassium (40 mM) during exposure to amlodipine. The onset and offset of amlodipine-induced inhibition in these arteries was slow, but concentration dependent. Depolarization markedly increased the rate of onset of inhibition. The increase in potency of amlodipine under depolarized conditions could largely be accounted for by the increased rate of association of the drug. Possible use-dependence of amlodipine was also examined in comparison with verapamil. The efficacy of both verapamil and amlodipine was increased in vessels which were repeatedly depolarized compared with vessels which were only activated once. This effect was more marked for verapamil than for amlodipine. The action of amlodipine in human resistance arteries is slow, shows marked voltage-dependence and, to a lesser degree, some use-dependence. These properties may be important in understanding the action of amlodipine in vivo.},

Addition of angiotensin II (AII) induced a concentration-dependent increase in tone in isolated arteries. The active metabolite of candesartan (CV 11974), losartan and the active metabolite of losartan, E-3174 antagonized AII-induced tone in a non-competitive manner, but the AT2 selective antagonist, PD123319, was without effect on responses to AII. The effects of candesartan, losartan and E-3174 were analysed using a classical model of non-competitive antagonism and a two-state receptor model. 3. Mechanical removal of the endothelium; pre-incubation with Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME); pre-incubation with indomethacin, a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor; or pre-incubation with BQ 485, an endothelin antagonist; had no significant effect on contractions induced by AII. 4. Our results suggest AII contracts human isolated resistance arteries by an action on AT1 receptors and does not involve release of endothelial factors. Use of a two-state receptor model successfully described the action of the AT1 antagonists without sacrificing assumptions regarding the competitive nature of binding of these antagonists.},

In some experiments, intracellular calcium [Ca(2+)]i was also measured using fura-2. 2. Angiotensin II (100 pM - 1 microM) increased [Ca(2+)]i and tone in a concentration-dependent manner. The effects of angiotensin II (100 nM) were inhibited by an AT1-receptor antagonist, candesartan (100 pM). 3. Ryanodine (10 microM), had no effect on angiotensin II-induced responses, but removal of extracellular Ca(2+) abolished angiotensin II-induced rise in [Ca(2+)]i and tone. Inhibition of Ca(2+) entry by Ni(2+) (2 mM), also inhibited angiotensin II responses. The dihydropyridine, L-type calcium channel antagonist, amlodipine (10 microM), only partially attenuated angiotensin II responses. 4. Inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) by chelerythrine (1 microM), or by overnight exposure to a phorbol ester (PDBu; 500 nM) had no effect on angiotensin II-induced contraction. 5. Genistein (10 microM), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, inhibited angiotensin II-induced contraction, but did not inhibit the rise in [Ca(2+)]i, suggesting that at this concentration it affected the calcium sensitivity of the contractile apparatus. Genistein did not affect responses to norepinephrine (NE) or high potassium (KPSS). 6. A selective MEK inhibitor, PD98059 (30 microM), inhibited both the angiotensin II-induced contraction and rise in [Ca(2+)]i, but had no effect on responses to NE or KPSS. 7. AT1 activation causes Ca(2+) influx via L-type calcium channels and a dihydropyridine-insensitive route, but does not release Ca(2+) from intracellular sites. Activation of tyrosine kinase(s) and the ERK 1/2 pathway, but not classical or novel PKC, also play a role in angiotensin II-induced contraction in human subcutaneous resistance arteries.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical practice evaluates cardiovascular risk based on current risk factor (RF) levels [Blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI) and glycaemic control] largely disregarding previous risk-factor history over the totality of the life course. RFs are related to contemporaneous echocardiographic measures of cardiac structure and function which in turn are independently related to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in cross-sectional studies. However, the effect of lifetime or earlier RF history on future echocardiographic changes has never been systematically examined. METHODS: A systematic review of the published literature identified 24 studies relating either earlier BP, BMI, glycaemic control or a combination to future cardiac structure and/or function. RESULTS: The majority of studies showed that elevated BP and BMI in earlier life and greater cumulative burden of these factors resulted in worse cardiac structure up to 24 years later. Studies examining glycaemic control as RF were few, but poorer glycaemic control in young adults was associated with increased future left ventricular mass. While only 5 papers related RFs to future cardiac function, all RFs were positively associated with worse future diastolic function. CONCLUSIONS: BP, BMI and glycaemic control measures in childhood, adolescence and early adulthood and subsequent longitudinal trajectories of BP and BMI are predictive of future abnormalities in cardiac structure and function. Lifetime RF history should be used to inform clinical practice. Further research is required to enable the identification of any sensitive periods in the life course to enable prevention when it is most likely to be effective.},

We investigated associations between BP at each age and rate of change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) between 36-43, 43-53, and 53-60/64 years on LVMI at 60-64 years. Blood pressure from 36 years was positively associated with LVMI. Association with SBP at 53 years was independent of SBP at 60-64 years and other potential confounders (fully adjusted beta at 53 years = 0.19 g/m(2); 95% CI: 0.11, 0.27; P < 0.001). Faster rates of increase in SBP from 43 to 53 years and 53 to 60/64 years were associated with increased LVMI. Similar relationships were seen for diastolic, pulse, and mean pressure. Rate of increase in SBP between 43-53 years was associated with largest change in LVMI (beta at 43-53 years = 3.12 g/m(2); 95% CI: 1.53, 4.72; P < 0.001). People on antihypertensive medication (43 years onwards) had greater LVMI even after adjustment for current BP (beta at 43 years = 12.36 g/m(2); 95% CI: 3.19, 21.53; P = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Higher BP in midlife and rapid rise of SBP in 5th decade is associated with higher LVMI in later life, independent of current BP. People with treated hypertension have higher LVMI than untreated individuals, even accounting for their higher BP. Our findings emphasize importance of midlife BP as risk factor for future CVD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: High blood pressure (BP) is associated with diastolic dysfunction, but the consequence of elevated BP over the adult life course on diastolic function is unknown. We hypothesised that high BP in earlier adulthood would be associated with impaired diastolic function independent of current BP. METHODS: Participants in the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development birth cohort (n=1653) underwent investigations including echocardiography at age 60-64 years. The relationships between adult BP, antihypertensive treatment (HTT) and echocardiographic measures of diastolic function were assessed using adjusted regression models. RESULTS: Increased systolic BP (SBP) at ages 36, 43 and 53 years was predictive of increased E/e' and increased left atrial volume. These effects were only partially explained by SBP at 60-64 years and increased left ventricular mass. HTT was also associated with poorer diastolic function after adjustment for SBP at 60-64 years. Faster rates of increase in SBP in midlife were also associated with increased poorer diastolic function. CONCLUSIONS: High SBP in midlife is associated with poorer diastolic function at age 60-64 years. Early identification of individuals with high BP or rapid rises in BP may be important for prevention of impaired cardiac function in later life.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study targeted carbon dioxide (CO(2)) oscillations seen in oscillatory ventilation with dynamic pre-emptive CO(2) administration. BACKGROUND: Oscillations in end-tidal CO(2) (et-CO(2)) drive the ventilatory oscillations of periodic breathing (PB) and central sleep apnea in heart failure (HF). METHODS: Seven healthy volunteers simulated PB, while undergoing dynamic CO(2) administration delivered by an automated algorithm at different concentrations and phases within the PB cycle. The algorithm was then tested in 7 patients with HF and PB. RESULTS: In voluntary PB, the greatest reduction (74%, p < 0.0001) in et-CO(2) oscillations was achieved when dynamic CO(2) was delivered at hyperventilation; when delivered at the opposite phase, the amplitude of et-CO(2) oscillations increased (35%, p = 0.001). In HF patients, oscillations in et-CO(2) were reduced by 43% and ventilatory oscillations by 68% (both p < 0.05). During dynamic CO(2) administration, mean et-CO(2) and ventilation levels remained unchanged. Static CO(2) (2%, constant flow) administration also attenuated spontaneous PB in HF patients (p = 0.02) but increased mean et-CO(2) (p = 0.03) and ventilation (by 45%, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic CO(2) administration, delivered at an appropriate time during PB, can almost eliminate oscillations in et-CO(2) and ventilation. This dynamic approach might be developed to treat central sleep apnea, as well as minimizing undesirable increases in et-CO(2) and ventilation.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Obesity clearly increases cardiovascular risk, often inducing high blood pressure (BP), impaired left ventricular (LV) function, and increased arterial stiffness. Intensive weight loss and bariatric surgery induce improvement in hypertension and diabetes for morbid obesity. Carotid artery haemodynamics is a powerful prognostic indicator for stroke and cognitive decline independent of BP. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a 3-stage bariatric strategy of diet, bariatric surgery, and consequent weight loss on carotid haemodynamics and cardiac diastolic function. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective study included 26 patients (45 +/- 10 years, 4 men) with severe obesity undergoing bariatric surgery without comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, etc.). Anthropometry, BP, Doppler echocardiography, and common carotid haemodynamics by ultrasound were measured at three times: (1) baseline, (2) after 1-month diet (post-diet), and (3) 8 months after surgery (post-surgery). The lnDU-loop method was used to estimate local carotid pulse wave velocity (ncPWV). RESULTS: Baseline BMI was 47.9 +/- 7.1 kg/m(2) and reduced by 5% and 30% post-diet and post-surgery, respectively. BP decreased only post-diet, without pulse pressure change. However, ncPWV, 6.27 +/- 1.35 m/s at baseline, was significantly reduced by 10% and 23% post-diet and post-surgery, respectively, also adjusted for BP changes. The E/A ratio rose from 0.95 +/- 0.20 to 1.27 +/- 0.31 (p < 0.005), without change in LV geometry or mass, while heart rate and cardiac output fell substantially. CONCLUSION: Weight loss following diet and bariatric surgery is associated with reduced carotid arterial stiffness and improved LV diastolic function. Diet and bariatric surgery are effective treatments for morbid obesity with its concomitant adverse cardiovascular effects.},

   abstract = {Image-based CID has been a prime technique for studying arteriosclerosis, plaque formation, aneurysm rupture and bypass design in the past decade. The imaging techniques used for vessel geometry acquisition are usually X-ray (CT-scan), intravascular ultrasound or most frequently MRI. It has been shown in previous studies that 3D extravascular ultrasound (3D US) can provide a cost-effective alternative for imaging superficial arteries like the carotid bifurcation or femoral arteries. In this study, the carotid bifurcation of 9 healthy subjects have been scanned twice within two to six weeks. CFD models for each subject and each scan were built using the corresponding anatomical data acquired in vivo. Overall reproducibility was satisfactory. Two main sources of error were identified. (1) Blurred border between vessel lumen and endothelium, causing the operator to overestimate the lumen area; and (2) altered neck angles. It is expected that with further improvement in ultrasound image quality and with standardisation of the imaging protocol, 3D US has a huge potential to become a viable alternative to MRI both for clinical and research uses.},

Currently, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is most widely used for in vivo geometry acquisition. For superficial arteries such as the carotids and the femoral artery, three-dimensional (3-D) extravascular ultrasound (3-DUS) could be a cost-effective alternative to MRI. In this study, nine healthy subjects were scanned both with MRI and 3-DUS. The reconstructed carotid artery geometries for each subject were compared by evaluating cross-sectional areas, centerlines, and carotid nonplanarity. Lumen areas agreed very well between the two different acquisition techniques, whereas centerlines and nonplanarity parameters showed measurable disagreement, possibly due to the different neck and head positions adopted for 3-DUS versus MRI. With the current level of agreement achieved, 3-DUS has the potential to become an inexpensive and fast alternative to MRI for image-based CFD modeling of superficial arteries.

   abstract = {Studies in adults have shown marked changes in geometry and relative positions of the carotid arteries when rotating the head. The aim of this study was to quantify the change in geometry and analyze its effect on carotid hemodynamics as a result of head rotation. The right carotid arteries of nine young adult subjects were investigated in supine position with straight and left turned head positions, respectively. The three-dimensional (3D) carotid geometry was reconstructed by using 3D ultrasound (3D US), and the carotid hemodynamics were calculated by combining 3D US with computational fluid dynamics. It was observed that cross-sectional areas and shapes did not change markedly with head rotation, but carotid vessel center lines altered with planarification of the common carotid artery as a main feature (P < 0.05). Measured common carotid flow rates changed significantly at the individual level when the head was turned, but on the average, the change in mean common carotid flow rate was relatively small (0.37 +/- 1.11 ml/s). The effect of the altered center lines and flow rates on the atherogenic nature of the carotid bifurcation was evaluated by using calculated hemodynamic wall parameters, such as wall shear stress (WSS) and oscillatory shear index (OSI). It was found that WSS and OSI patterns changed significantly with head rotation, but the variations were very subject dependent and could not have been predicted without assessing the altered geometry and flow of the carotid bifurcation for individual cases. This study suggests that there is a need for standardization of the choice of head position in the 3D US scan protocol, and that carotid stents and emboli diverters should be studied in different head positions.},

   abstract = {The association between vascular wall shear stress (WSS) and the local development of atherosclerotic plaque makes estimation of in vivo WSS of considerable interest. Three-dimensional ultrasound (3DUS) combined with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provides a potentially valuable tool for acquiring subject-specific WSS, but the interoperator and intraoperator variability associated with WSS calculations using this method is not known. Here, the accuracy, reproducibility and operator dependence of 3DUS-based computational fluid dynamics were examined through a phantom and in vivo studies. A carotid phantom was scanned and reconstructed by two operators. In the in vivo study, four operators scanned a healthy subject a total of 11 times, and their scan data were processed by three individuals. The study showed that with some basic training, operators could acquire accurate carotid geometry for flow reconstructions. The variability of measured cross-sectional area and predicted shear stress was 8.17% and 0.193 N/m2 respectively for the in vivo study. It was shown that the variability of the examined parameters was more dependent on the scan operators than the image processing operator. The range of variability of geometrical and flow parameters reported here can be used as a reference for future in vivo studies using the 3DUS-based CFD approach.},

   abstract = {The importance of shear stress in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis has been recognized for some time. A novel way to quantify wall shear stress under physiologically realistic conditions is to combine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computational fluid dynamics. The present study aims to investigate the reproducibility of the simulated flow by using this combined approach. The right carotid bifurcations of eight healthy subjects were scanned twice with MRI within a few weeks. Three-dimensional geometries of the vessels were reconstructed for each scan and each subject. Pulsatile flows through these models were calculated to assess errors associated with the predicted flow parameters. This was done by comparing various wall shear stress indices, including the time-averaged wall shear stress (WSS), oscillating shear index (OSI), WSS Gradients (WSSG) and WSS Angle Deviation (WSSAD). Qualitatively, all the wall shear parameters proved to be highly reproducible. Quantitatively, the reproducibility was over 90% for OSI and WSSAD, but less impressive (60%) for other parameters. Our results indicated that WSS and WSSG values were extremely sensitive to subtle variations in local geometry and mesh design, particularly in regions around the bifurcation apex where WSS values were high and least reproducible.},

The targets are further prioritized using independent replication, co-localization, protein expression profiles and data from the British National Formulary and clinicaltrials.gov. Out of the 341 drug targets identified through their association with blood lipids (HDL-C, LDL-C and triglycerides), we robustly prioritize 30 targets that might elicit beneficial effects in the prevention or treatment of CHD, including NPC1L1 and PCSK9, the targets of drugs used in CHD prevention. We discuss how this approach can be generalized to other targets, disease biomarkers and endpoints to help prioritize and validate targets during the drug development process.},

   abstract = {Greater blood pressure (BP) is associated with greater left ventricular mass indexed to height2.7 (LVMi2.7) in adolescents. This study examined whether greater BP variability and reduced night-time dipping are associated with cardiac remodeling in a general population of adolescents. A cross-sectional analysis was undertaken in 587 UK adolescents (mean age 17.7 years; 43.1% male). BP was measured in a research clinic and using 24-hour ambulatory monitoring. We examined associations (for both systolic and diastolic BP) of: 1) clinic and 24-hour mean BP; 2) measures of 24-hour BP variability: standard deviation weighted for day/night (SDdn), variability independent of the mean (VIM) and average real variability (ARV); and 3) night-time dipping with cardiac structures. Cardiac structures were assessed by echocardiography: 1) LVMi2.7; 2) relative wall thickness (RWT); 3) left atrial diameter indexed to height (LADi) and 4) left ventricular internal diameter in diastole (LVIDD). Higher systolic BP was associated with greater LVMi2.7. Systolic and diastolic BP were associated with greater RWT. Associations were inconsistent for LADi and LVIDD. There was evidence for associations between both greater SDdn and ARV and higher RWT (per 1 SD higher diastolic ARV, mean difference in RWT was 0.13 SDs, 95% CI 0.045 to 0.21); these associations with RWT remained after adjustment for mean BP. There was no consistent evidence of associations between night-time dipping and cardiac structure. Measurement of BP variability, even in adolescents with blood pressure in the physiologic range, might benefit risk of cardiovascular remodeling assessment.},

   abstract = {RATIONALE: Lung function in early adulthood is associated with subsequent adverse health outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To ascertain whether stable and reproducible lung function trajectories can be derived in different populations and investigate their association with objective measures of cardiovascular structure and function. METHODS: Using latent profile modelling, we studied three population-based birth cohorts with repeat spirometry data from childhood into early adulthood to identify trajectories of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1))/forced vital capacity (FVC). We used multinomial logistic regression models to investigate early-life predictors of the derived trajectories. We then ascertained the extent of the association between the derived FEV(1)/FVC trajectories and blood pressure and echocardiographic markers of increased cardiovascular risk and stroke in ~3200 participants at age 24 years in one of our cohorts. RESULTS: We identified four FEV(1)/FVC trajectories with strikingly similar latent profiles across cohorts (pooled N=6377): above average (49.5%); average (38.3%); below average (10.6%); and persistently low (1.7%). Male sex, wheeze, asthma diagnosis/medication and allergic sensitisation were associated with trajectories with diminished lung function in all cohorts. We found evidence of an increase in cardiovascular risk markers ascertained by echocardiography (including left ventricular mass indexed to height and carotid intima-media thickness) with decreasing FEV(1)/FVC (with p values for the mean crude effects per-trajectory ranging from 0.10 to p<0.001). In this analysis, we considered trajectories as a pseudo-continuous variable; we confirmed the assumption of linearity in all the regression models. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood lung function trajectories may serve as predictors in the development of not only future lung disease, but also the cardiovascular disease and multimorbidity in adulthood.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Employment disruptions can impact smoking and alcohol consumption. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries implemented furlough schemes to prevent job loss. We examine how furlough was associated with smoking, vaping and alcohol consumption in the UK. METHODS: Data from 27,841 participants in eight UK adult longitudinal surveys were analysed. Participants self-reported employment status and current smoking, current vaping and alcohol consumption (>4 days/week or 5+ drinks per typical occasion) both before and during the early stages of the pandemic (April-July 2020). Risk ratios were estimated within each study using modified Poisson regression, adjusting for a range of potential confounders, including pre-pandemic behaviour. Findings were synthesised using random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: Compared to stable employment and after adjustment for pre-pandemic characteristics, furlough was not associated with smoking (ARR = 1.05; 95% CI: 0.95-1.16; I(2): 10%), vaping (ARR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.74-1.08; I(2): 0%) or drinking (ARR = 1.03; 95% CI: 0.94-1.13; I(2): 48%). There were similar findings for no longer being employed, and stable unemployment, though this varied by sex: stable unemployment was associated with smoking for women (ARR = 1.35; 95% CI: 1.00-1.82; I(2): 47%) but not men (0.84; 95% CI: 0.67-1.05; I(2): 0%). No longer being employed was associated with vaping among women (ARR = 2.74; 95% CI: 1.59-4.72; I(2): 0%) but not men (ARR = 1.25; 95% CI: 0.83-1.87; I(2): 0%). CONCLUSIONS: We found no clear evidence of furlough or unemployment having adverse impacts on smoking, vaping or drinking behaviours during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Differences in risk compared to those who remained employed were largely explained by pre-pandemic characteristics.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: We aimed to investigate associations between common infections and neuroimaging markers of dementia risk (brain volume, hippocampal volume, white matter lesions) across three population-based studies. METHODS: We tested associations between serology measures (pathogen serostatus, cumulative burden, continuous antibody responses) and outcomes using linear regression, including adjustments for total intracranial volume and scanner/clinic information (basic model), age, sex, ethnicity, education, socioeconomic position, alcohol, body mass index, and smoking (fully adjusted model). Interactions between serology measures and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype were tested. Findings were meta-analyzed across cohorts (N(main) = 2632; N(APOE-interaction) = 1810). RESULTS: Seropositivity to John Cunningham virus associated with smaller brain volumes in basic models (beta = -3.89 mL [-5.81, -1.97], P(adjusted) < 0.05); these were largely attenuated in fully adjusted models (beta = -1.59 mL [-3.55, 0.36], P = 0.11). No other relationships were robust to multiple testing corrections and sensitivity analyses, but several suggestive associations were observed. DISCUSSION: We did not find clear evidence for relationships between common infections and markers of dementia risk. Some suggestive findings warrant testing for replication.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: This study establishes a multiphysics simulation platform for both conventional and targeted thrombolysis using tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Based on our computational results, the effects of therapeutic parameters on the dynamics of thrombolysis and the risk of side effects are investigated. METHODS: The model extends our previously developed one-dimensional(1D) mathematical models for fibrinolysis by incorporating targeted thrombolysis. It consists of two parts: (i) a coupled mathematical model of systemic pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) and local PD in a 1D occluded artery, and (ii) a mechanistic model for a targeted thrombolytic system via activated platelet-targeted tPA-loaded nanovesicles (tPA-NV), with model parameters derived from our in vitro experiments. A total of 16 therapeutic scenarios are simulated by varying the clot location and composition as well as the dosing regimen with free tPA or tPA-NV. RESULTS: Our simulation results indicate that tPA-NV offers several advantages over free tPA for thrombolysis. It reduces systemic exposure of tPA, thereby minimising the risk of bleeding complications. Simulations with different tPA-NV doses reveal that tPA-NV at 10% of the recommended dose can be as effective as the standard regimen with the full recommended dose of free tPA, demonstrating the potential of our tPA-NV as a new thrombolytic strategy with a reduced tPA dose. Moreover, faster recanalisation can be achieved with tPA-NV, especially for platelet-rich(or fibrin-poor) clots. CONCLUSIONS: Our simulation platform for thrombolysis with well-tuned model parameters can be used to evaluate and optimise treatment regimens of existing and new thrombolytic therapies via benefit/risk assessment under various therapeutic scenarios.},

   abstract = {Thrombolytic therapy is one of the medical procedures in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke (AIS), whereby the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is intravenously administered to dissolve the obstructive blood clot. The treatment of AIS by thrombolysis can sometimes be ineffective and it can cause serious complications, such as intracranial haemorrhage (ICH). In this study, we propose an efficient mathematical modelling approach that can be used to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of thrombolysis in various clinically relevant scenarios. Our model combines the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of tPA with local clot lysis dynamics. By varying the drug dose, bolus-infusion delay time, and bolus-infusion ratio, with the FDA approved dosing protocol serving as a reference, we have used the model to simulate 13 dose regimens. Simulation results are compared for temporal concentrations of fibrinolytic proteins in plasma and the time that is taken to achieve recanalisation. Our results show that high infusion rates can cause the rapid degradation of plasma fibrinogen, indicative of increased risk for ICH, but they do not necessarily lead to fast recanalisation. In addition, a bolus-infusion delay results in an immediate drop in plasma tPA concentration, which prolongs the time to achieve recanalisation. Therefore, an optimal administration regimen should be sought by keeping the tPA level sufficiently high throughout the treatment and maximising the lysis rate while also limiting the degradation of fibrinogen in systemic plasma. This can be achieved through model-based optimisation in the future.},

   abstract = {Acute ischaemic stroke can be treated by intravenous thrombolysis whereby tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is infused to dissolve clots that block blood supply to the brain. In this study, we aim to examine the influence of clot location and size on lysis pattern and recanalisation by using a recently developed computational modelling framework for thrombolysis under physiological flow conditions. An image-based patient-specific model is reconstructed which consists of the internal carotid bifurcation with the A1 segment of anterior cerebral arteries and M1 segment of middle cerebral arteries, and the M1 bifurcation containing the M2 segments. By varying the clot size and location, 7 scenarios are simulated mimicking thrombolysis of M1 and M2 occlusions. Our results show that initial breakthrough always occurs along the inner curvature of the occluded cerebral artery, due to prolonged tPA residence time in the recirculation zone. For a given occlusion site, lysis completion time appears to increase almost quadratically with the initial clot volume; whereas for a given clot volume, the simulated M2 occlusions take up to 30% longer for complete lysis compared to the corresponding M1 occlusions.},

   abstract = {Despite having almost identical origins and similar perfusion pressures, the flow-velocity waveforms in the left and right coronary arteries are strikingly different. We hypothesized that pressure differences originating from the distal (microcirculatory) bed would account for the differences in the flow-velocity waveform. We used wave intensity analysis to separate and quantify proximal- and distal-originating pressures to study the differences in velocity waveforms. In 20 subjects with unobstructed coronary arteries, sensor-tipped intra-arterial wires were used to measure simultaneous pressure and Doppler velocity in the proximal left main stem (LMS) and proximal right coronary artery (RCA). Proximal- and distal-originating waves were separated using wave intensity analysis, and differences in waves were examined in relation to structural and anatomic differences between the two arteries. Diastolic flow velocity was lower in the RCA than in the LMS (35.1 +/- 21.4 vs. 56.4 +/- 32.5 cm/s, P < 0.002), and, consequently, the diastolic-to-systolic ratio of peak flow velocity in the RCA was significantly less than in the LMS (1.00 +/- 0.32 vs. 1.79 +/- 0.48, P < 0.001). This was due to a lower distal-originating suction wave (8.2 +/- 6.6 x 10(3) vs. 16.0 +/- 12.2 x 10(3) W.m(-2).s(-1), P < 0.01). The suction wave in the LMS correlated positively with left ventricular pressure (r = 0.6, P < 0.01) and in the RCA with estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (r = 0.7, P = 0.05) but not with the respective diameter in these arteries. In contrast to the LMS, where coronary flow velocity was predominantly diastolic, in the proximal RCA coronary flow velocity was similar in systole and diastole. This difference was due to a smaller distal-originating suction wave in the RCA, which can be explained by differences in elastance and pressure generated between right and left ventricles.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Analysis of the arterial pressure curve plays an increasing role in cardiovascular risk stratification. Measures of wave reflection and aortic stiffness have been identified as independent predictors of risk. Their determination is usually based on wave propagation models of the circulation. Another modeling approach relies on modified Windkessel models, where pressure curves can be divided into reservoir and excess pressure. Little is known of their prognostic value. METHODS AND RESULTS: The aim of this study is to evaluate the predictive value of parameters gained from reservoir theory applied to aortic pressure curves in a cohort of high-risk patients. Furthermore the relation of these parameters to those from wave separation analysis is investigated. Central pressure curves from 674 patients with preserved ejection fraction, measured by radial tonometry and a validated transfer function, were analyzed. A high correlation between the amplitudes of backward traveling pressure waves and reservoir pressures was found (R=0.97). Various parameters calculated from the reservoir and excess pressure waveforms predicted cardiovascular events in univariate Cox proportional hazards modeling. In a multivariate model including several other risk factors such as brachial blood pressure, the amplitude of reservoir pressure remained a significant predictor (HR=1.37 per SD, p=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Based on very different models, parameters from reservoir theory and wave separation analysis are closely related and can predict cardiovascular events to a similar extent. Although Windkessel models cannot describe all of the physiological properties of the arterial system, they can be useful to analyze its behavior and to predict cardiovascular events.},

We assessed the relationship of pubertal timing, in both men (n = 672) and women (n = 713), with vascular (carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), pulse wave velocity (PWV)) and cardiac (left ventricular (LV) structure and function) measures recorded at age 60-64 yrs in a British birth cohort study. Regression models found that earlier menarche was associated with higher (more adverse) LV mass, LV end diastolic volume and left atrial volume, but not with other cardiac measures, cIMT or PWV. Associations were attenuated after adjustment for either adult or childhood BMI (e.g. mean difference in LV mass per year later menarche: -4.2 g (95% CI:-7.0,-1.4) reducing to -2.2 g (95% CI:-4.7,0.4) after adjustment for adult BMI). There were no associations among men, despite those fully mature at 15 yrs having higher blood pressure than the least mature group by 10.21 mmHg (95% CI:19.45,0.98). Any effect of pubertal timing on vascular and cardiac structure and function is likely to be small and primarily confounded by pre-pubertal BMI and/or mediated through adult adiposity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hypoxia causes vasodilatation of coronary arteries, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We hypothesized that hypoxia reduces intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) by opening of K channels and release of H(2)S. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Porcine coronary arteries without endothelium were mounted for measurement of isometric tension and [Ca(2+)](i), and the expression of voltage-gated K channels K(V)7 channels (encoded by KCNQ genes) and large-conductance calcium-activated K channels (K(Ca)1.1) was examined. Voltage clamp assessed the role of K(V)7 channels in hypoxia. KEY RESULTS: Gradual reduction of oxygen concentration from 95 to 1% dilated the precontracted coronary arteries and this was associated with reduced [Ca(2+)](i) in PGF(2alpha) (10 muM)-contracted arteries whereas no fall in [Ca(2+)](i) was observed in 30 mM K-contracted arteries. Blockers of ATP-sensitive voltage-gated potassium channels and K(Ca)1.1 inhibited hypoxia-induced dilatation in PGF2alpha -contracted arteries; this inhibition was more marked in the presence of the K(v)7 channel blockers, XE991 and linopirdine, while a K(V)7.1 blocker, failed to change hypoxic vasodilatation. XE991 also inhibited H(2)S- and adenosine-induced vasodilatation. PCR revealed the expression of K(V)7.1, K(V)7.4, K(V)7.5 and K(Ca)1.1 channels, and K(Ca)1.1, K(V)7.4 and K(V)7.5 were also identified by immunoblotting. Voltage clamp studies showed the XE991-sensitive current was more marked in hypoxic conditions. CONCLUSION: The K(V)7.4 and K(V)7.5 channels, which we identified in the coronary arteries, appear to have a major role in hypoxia-induced vasodilatation. The voltage clamp results further support the involvement of K(V)7 channels in this vasodilatation. Activation of these K(V)7 channels may be induced by H(2)S and adenosine.},

   abstract = {Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an optical technique that can be used to non-invasively interrogate haemodynamic changes within skeletal muscle. It can be combined with a short (3-5 min) arterial cuff-occlusion to quantify post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia (PORH). This technique has utility in tracking changes in vascular health in relation to exercise, disease progression or treatment efficacy. However, methods for assessing PORH vary widely and there is little consensus on methodological approaches such as sampling frequency, correction for adipose tissue or the analysis endpoints. The purpose of this review was to: (1) summarise recent advances; (2) compare different methodological approaches and (3) identify current knowledge gaps and future objectives for use of NIRS for vascular assessment. We propose key areas for future work, including optimising occlusion duration and comparing methods of correction for the ischemic stimulus, standardising methods for adjustment of adipose tissue thickness, cross-device comparisons and establishing a standard for minimum sampling rate. Comparisons with alternative methods of capturing PORH or upstream vasodilatory responses would be valuable. Addressing these methodological considerations will aid our understanding of this useful, non-invasive tool for characterising PORH within skeletal muscle and facilitate interpretation of results across studies.},

   abstract = {The actions of the optical enantiomers of BAY K 8644 and Sandoz 202,791 were studied on barium inward currents recorded using the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique from enzymatically isolated smooth muscle cells from the rabbit ear artery. The enantiomers were applied by bath perfusion or rapidly by a concentration jump technique, which enabled the study of drug action under equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions. A larger effect of agonists was seen on peak inward current in 110 mM Ba when small rather than large depolarizations were applied. The midpoint voltage of the steady-state inactivation curve of IBa was -12.8 +/- 1.9 mV (n = 4) in the absence of drug, -16.4 +/- 2.5 mV (n = 4) in 1 microM (+)202,791, and -31.4 +/- 0.4 mV (n = 4) in 1 microM (-)202,791. The rate of onset of action of the agonist and antagonist enantiomers of BAY K 8644 and Sandoz 202,791 was studied by rapid application during 20-ms depolarizing steps from different holding potentials to +30 mV at 1 or 0.2 Hz. The drugs were applied as concentration jumps between two single pulses of a pulse train. The rates of onset of drug action on peak IBa during a 1-Hz pulse train were concentration dependent over the range of 100 nM-3 microM for both (+) and (-)202,791. The rate of onset of inhibition of peak current by antagonist enantiomers was not significantly influenced by the test pulse frequency. At a holding potential of -60 mV, the onset rate of the increase in peak IBa on application of 1 microM of agonist enantiomers (+)202,791 or (-)BAY K 8644 during a train of pulses occurred with mean time constants of 2.1 +/- 0.7 s (n = 7) and 2.3 +/- 0.2 s (n = 4), respectively. The onset of current increase on application of 1 microM (+)202,791 during a single voltage clamp step to 20 mV was faster, with a mean time constant of 380 +/- 80 ms (n = 3).},

   abstract = {The augmentation index (AIx) is deemed to capture the deleterious effect on left ventricular (LV) work of increased wave reflection associated with stiffer arteries. However, its validity as a proxy for wave reflection magnitude has been questioned. We hypothesized that, in addition to increased wave reflection due to increased pulse wave velocity, LV myocardial shortening velocity influences AIx. Using a computational model of the circulation, we investigated the isolated and combined influences of myocardial shortening velocity vs,LV and arterial stiffness on AIx. Aortic blood pressure waveforms were characterized using AIx and the reflected wave pressure amplitude (pbw, obtained using wave separation analysis). Our reference simulation (normal vs,LV and arterial stiffness) was characterized by an AIx of 21%. A realistic reduction in vs,LV caused AIx to increase from 21 to 42%. An arterial stiffness increase, characterized by a relevant 1.0 m/s increase in carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, caused AIx to increase from 21 to 41%. Combining the reduced vs,LV and increased arterial stiffness resulted in an AIx of 54%. In a multistep parametric analysis, both vs,LV and arterial stiffness were about equal determinants of AIx, whereas pbw was only determined by arterial stiffness. Furthermore, the relation between increased AIx and LV stroke work was only approximately 50% explained by an increase in arterial stiffness, the other factor being vs,LV. The pbw, on the other hand, related less ambiguously to LV stroke work. We conclude that the AIx reflects both cardiac and vascular properties and should not be considered an exclusively vascular parameter.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We used a state-of-the-art computational model to mechanistically investigate the validity of the augmentation index (AIx) as a proxy for (changes in) wave reflection. In contrary to current belief, we found that LV contraction velocity influences AIx as much as increased arterial stiffness, and increased AIx does not necessarily relate to an increase in LV stroke work. Wave reflection magnitude derived from considering pressure, as well as flow, does qualify as a determinant of LV stroke work.},

   abstract = {5-Hydroxytryptamine(1B/1D) (5-HT(1B/1D)) receptor coupling to contraction was investigated in endothelium-denuded rabbit isolated renal arteries, by simultaneously measuring tension and intracellular [Ca(2+)], and tension in permeabilized smooth muscle cells. In intact arterial segments, 1 nM - 10 microM 5-HT failed to induce contraction or increase the fura-2 fluorescence ratio (in the presence of 1 microM ketanserin and prazosin to block 5-HT(2) and alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors, respectively). However, in vessels pre-exposed to either 20 mM K(+) or 30 nM U46619, 5-HT stimulated concentration-dependent increases in both tension and intracellular [Ca(2+)]. 1 nM - 10 microM U46619 induced concentration-dependent contractions. In the presence of nifedipine (0.3 and 1 microM) the maximal contraction to U46619 (10 microM) was reduced by around 70%. The residual contraction was abolished by the putative receptor operated channel inhibitor, SKF 96365 (2 microM). With 0.3 microM nifedipine present, 100 nM U46619 evoked similar contraction to 30 nM U46619 in the absence of nifedipine, but contraction to 5-HT (1 nM - 10 microM) was abolished. In permeabilized arterial segments, 10 mM caffeine, 1 microM IP(3) or 100 microM phenylephrine, each evoked transient contractions by releasing Ca(2+) from intracellular stores, whereas 5-HT had no effect. In intact arterial segments pre-stimulated with 20 mM K(+), 5-HT-evoked contractions were unaffected by 1 microM thapsigargin, which inhibits sarco- and endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPases. In vessels permeabilized with alpha-toxin and then pre-contracted with Ca(2+) and GTP, 5-HT evoked further contraction, reflecting increased myofilament Ca(2+)-sensitivity. Contraction linked to 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor stimulation in the rabbit renal artery can be explained by an influx of external Ca(2+) through voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels and sensitization of the contractile myofilaments to existing levels of Ca(2+), with no release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease has been associated with an increased dementia risk, but the underlying mechanisms for this heart-brain link are unclear. This study sought to examine associations between aortic and carotid artery structure with cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), and cognition in later-life. METHODS: One hundred sixty three participants (25.8% female) from the Whitehall II Imaging cohort completed two examinations (M +/- SD age 68.2 +/- 4.4 at Wave-1 and 76.9 +/- 4.5 at Wave-2) of neuropsychological assessments and 3T brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) FLAIR scans to quantify WMHs. Wave-2 additionally included vascular sonography of the aorta and carotid artery, and 3T functional MRI scans to measure CVR (mean % change BOLD signal change during a CO(2) challenge). Wave-2 factor scores of aortic and carotid arterial diameters, stiffness, and compliance were the exposure variables. Midlife Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Score (FRS) measured before Wave-1 was a potential effect modifier. WMH volume, grey matter CVR, cognitive factor scores (episodic memory, working memory, executive function, visuospatial memory, fluency, lexical retrieval) at Wave-2, and changes in WMH and cognition between Wave-1 and Wave-2 were used as outcome variables. RESULTS: Larger aortic diameter (ss = 0.38, SE = 0.11) and greater aortic stiffness (ss = 0.27, SE = 0.10) were associated with larger carotid diameter, independently of body size. Higher midlife FRS was associated with larger aortic and carotid diameters and increased carotid stiffness in old age. We observed notable artery-brain associations, such that larger aortic (ss = 0.17, SE = 0.06) and carotid diameters (ss = 0.11, SE = 0.05) were associated with larger WMH lesion volumes at Wave-2. Larger aortic diameter (ss = 0.08 SE = 0.03) and lower carotid compliance (ss = - 0.06, SE = 0.02) at Wave-2 were also associated with greater longitudinal increases in WMH volumes over the preceding 9 years. Higher stiffness and lower compliance of the aorta and carotid were associated with worse cognitive outcomes across a range of domains, and these associations were moderated by midlife FRS. Larger carotid diameter was associated with higher cerebrovascular reactivity (ss = 0.02, SE = 0.01), suggesting a potential compensatory pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse structural and functional changes in the aorta and carotid artery were inter-related and associated with vascular brain lesions, cerebrovascular reactivity, and poorer cognitive outcomes in older age.},

A complete description of arterial mechanical properties in vivo is not possible, although a number of methods have been used. 2. Detailed discussion in the present review is limited to pulse wave velocity and estimates of central waveform morphology derived by the application of a generalized arterial transfer function. 3. Many drugs affect these parameters, either increasing or decreasing apparent stiffness. However, the extent to which changes reflect changes in blood pressure rather than more fundamental vessel wall properties remains unclear. Similarly, it is as yet unknown whether determining the need for, or assessing the effectiveness of, drug treatment by the assessment of arterial mechanical properties will offer any advantage and the usefulness of these techniques as routine clinical tools remains to be established.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Small size at birth and greater BMI in childhood are associated with greater brachial blood pressure (BP) in later life. Aortic (central) BP differs from brachial BP and is more predictive of organ damage and cardiovascular events; the relationship between BMI in childhood and central BP is not known. METHODS: Using data from 3154 people from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, we assessed associations between repeated measures of BMI from birth to age 10 with central and brachial BP at age 17. RESULTS: Lower BMI at birth (thinness) was associated with greater central and brachial BP. No associations were seen between BMI in early childhood (<7 years) and later BP, but greater BMI from 7 to 10 years was associated with higher BP. Associations were similar for central and brachial SBP and for DBP, and were stronger in males compared with females. The highest BP was seen in participants who were low-birth-weight and overweight or obese at both the end of infancy (age 2) and at the time of BP assessment (age 17); mean central SBP was 104.2 mmHg (SD = 11.0) compared with 100.7 (SD = 10.5) in participants who were normal-birth-weight and overweight or obese at 2 and 17 years. CONCLUSION: Small size at birth followed by rapid adiposity gain in infancy and continued overweight/obesity are associated with greater BP in young adulthood. These findings emphasize the importance of maintenance of normal weight in childhood for the prevention of high BP.},

   abstract = {Using an in vitro model of a conditionally immortalized cell line, we have investigated how human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are affected by the expression of simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen (LT antigen), which binds to cell cycle regulators such as the tumor suppressor protein p53. Cells were obtained after infection of saphenous vein-derived VSMCs with a nonreplicative retroviral vector containing a temperature-sensitive mutant of SV40 LT antigen and were shown to have maintained some characteristics and responses of VSMCs. Under permissive-temperature conditions (36 degrees C), the increased rate of cell proliferation was shown to be associated with expression of LT antigen and with LT antigen binding to and inactivation of p53. p53 inactivation failed to block apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal or UV irradiation. Downregulation of LT antigen expression at a nonpermissive temperature (39 degrees C) was shown to be associated with growth arrest, increased expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21(WAF1/CIP1), increased murine double minute-2 promoter activity, and differential expression of murine double minute-2 gene products, suggesting that p53-induced transcription/transactivation may be involved in VSMC cycle control but not necessarily in apoptosis. The established SMC line HVTs-SM1 may be a useful model for study of the processes involved in myointimal hyperplasia and cellular aging, as well as for the study of cell cycle control in general.},

   abstract = {Clinical use of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in thrombolytic therapy is limited by its short circulation time and hemorrhagic side effects. Inspired by fibrinogen binding to activated platelets, we report a fibrinogen-mimicking, multiarm nanovesicle for thrombus-specific tPA delivery and targeted thrombolysis. This biomimetic system is based on the lipid nanovesicle coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) terminally conjugated with a cyclic RGD (cRGD) peptide. Our experiments with human blood demonstrated its highly selective binding to activated platelets and efficient tPA release at a thrombus site under both static and physiological flow conditions. Its clot dissolution time in a microfluidic system was comparable to that of free tPA. Furthermore, we report a purpose-built computational model capable of simulating targeted thrombolysis of the tPA-loaded nanovesicle and with a potential in predicting the dynamics of thrombolysis in physiologically realistic scenarios. This combined experimental and computational work presents a promising platform for development of thrombolytic nanomedicines.},

   abstract = {It remains a major challenge to develop a selective and effective fibrinolytic system for thrombolysis with minimal undesirable side effects. Herein, we report a multifunctional liposomal system (164.6+/-5.3nm in diameter) which can address this challenge through targeted delivery and controlled release of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) at the thrombus site. The tPA-loaded liposomes were PEGylated to improve their stability, and surface coated with a conformationally-constrained, cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (cRGD) to enable highly selective binding to activated platelets. The in vitro drug release profiles at 37 degrees C showed that over 90% of tPA was released through liposomal membrane destabilization involving membrane fusion upon incubation with activated platelets within 1h, whereas passive release of the encapsulated tPA in pH 7.4 PBS buffer was 10% after 6h. The release of tPA could be readily manipulated by changing the concentration of activated platelets. The presence of activated platelets enabled the tPA-loaded, cRGD-coated, PEGylated liposomes to induce efficient fibrin clot lysis in a fibrin-agar plate model and the encapsulated tPA retained 97.4+/-1.7% of fibrinolytic activity as compared with that of native tPA. Furthermore, almost complete blood clot lysis was achieved in 75min, showing considerably higher and quicker thrombolytic activity compared to the tPA-loaded liposomes without cRGD labelling. These results suggest that the nano-sized, activated-platelet-sensitive, multifunctional liposomes could facilitate selective delivery and effective release of tPA at the site of thrombus, thus achieving efficient clot dissolution whilst minimising undesirable side effects.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Exaggerated exercise blood pressure (BP) is associated with altered cardiac structure and increased cardiovascular risk. Fitness modifies these associations, but the effect in healthy adolescents is unknown. We performed an observational study to determine the influence of fitness on post-exercise BP, and on its relationship with cardiac structure in adolescents. METHODS: 4835 adolescents from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, (15.4 (0.3) years, 49% male) completed a submaximal cycle test. Fitness was estimated as physical work capacity 170 adjusted for lean body mass and post-exercise BP measured immediately posttest. Cardiovascular structure and function, including left ventricular (LV) mass (n = 1589), left atrium (LA) size (n = 1466), cardiac output (CO, n = 1610), and total peripheral resistance (TPR, n = 1610) were measured at rest by echocardiography 2.4 (0.4) years later. RESULTS: Post-exercise systolic BP increased stepwise by fitness tertile (131.2 mm Hg [130.4, 132.1]; 137.3 mm Hg [136.5, 138.0]; 142.3 mm Hg [141.5, 143.1]). Each 5 mm Hg of post-exercise systolic BP was associated with 2.46 g [1.91, 3.01] greater LV mass, 0.02 cm [0.02, 0.03] greater LA size, and 0.25 g/m(2.7) [0.14, 0.36] greater LV mass index. Adjustment for fitness abolished associations (0.29 g [-0.16, 0.74]; 0.01 cm [-0.001, 0.014] and 0.08 g/m(2.7) [-0.001, 0.002]). Similar associations between post-exercise systolic BP and each outcome were found between the lowest and highest fitness thirds. CO increased with fitness third (difference 0.06 L/min [-0.05, 0.17]; 0.23 L/min [0.12, 0.34]) while TPR decreased (difference -0.13 mm Hg.min/L [-0.84,0.59]; -1.08 mm Hg.min/L [-0.1.80, 0.35]). CONCLUSIONS: Post-exercise systolic BP increased with fitness, which modified its association with cardiac structure. Higher CO, but lower TPR suggests a physiologically adapted cardiovascular system with greater fitness, highlighting the importance of fitness in adolescence.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Exaggerated exercise blood pressure (BP) is associated with cardiovascular risk factors in adolescence. Cardiorespiratory fitness and adiposity (fatness) are independent contributors to cardiovascular risk, but their interrelated associations with exercise BP are unknown. This study aimed to determine the relationships between fitness, fatness, and the acute BP response to exercise in a large birth cohort of adolescents. METHODS: 2292 adolescents from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (aged 17.8 +/- 0.4 years, 38.5% male) completed a sub-maximal exercise step test that allowed fitness (VO2 max ) to be determined from workload and heart rate using a validated equation. Exercise BP was measured immediately on test cessation and fatness calculated as the ratio of total fat mass to total body mass measured by DXA. RESULTS: Post-exercise systolic BP decreased stepwise with tertile of fitness (146 (18); 142 (17); 141 (16) mmHg) but increased with tertile of fatness (138 (15); 142 (16); 149 (18) mmHg). In separate models, fitness and fatness were associated with post-exercise systolic BP adjusted for sex, age, height, smoking, and socioeconomic status (standardized beta: -1.80, 95%CI: -2.64, -0.95 mmHg/SD and 4.31, 95%CI: 3.49, 5.13 mmHg/SD). However, when fitness and fatness were included in the same model, only fatness remained associated with exercise BP (4.65, 95%CI: 3.69, 5.61 mmHg/SD). CONCLUSION: Both fitness and fatness are associated with the acute BP response to exercise in adolescence. The fitness-exercise BP association was not independent of fatness, implying the cardiovascular protective effects of cardiorespiratory fitness may only be realized with more favorable body composition.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Masked hypertension is associated with increased cardiovascular risk but is undetectable by clinic blood pressure (BP). Elevated systolic BP responses to submaximal exercise reveal the presence of masked hypertension in adults, but it is unknown whether this is the case during adolescence. We aimed to determine if exercise BP was raised in adolescents with masked hypertension, and its association with cardiovascular risk markers. METHODS: A total of 657 adolescents (aged 17.7 +/- 0.3 years; 41.9% male) from the Avon longitudinal study of parents and children (ALSPAC) completed a step-exercise test with pre-, post-, and recovery-exercise BP, clinic BP and 24-hour ambulatory BP. Masked hypertension was defined as clinic BP <140/90 mm Hg and 24-hour ambulatory BP >/=130/80 mm Hg. Assessment of left-ventricular (LV) mass index and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (aortic PWV) was also undertaken. Thresholds of clinic, pre-, post-, and recovery-exercise systolic BP were explored from ROC analysis to identify masked hypertension. RESULTS: Fifty participants (7.8%) were classified with masked hypertension. Clinic, pre-, post-, and recovery-exercise systolic BP were associated with masked hypertension (AUC >/= 0.69 for all, respectively), with the clinic systolic BP threshold of 115 mm Hg having high sensitivity and specificity and exercise BP thresholds of 126, 150, and 130 mm Hg, respectively, having high specificity and negative predictive value (individually or when combined) for ruling out the presence of masked hypertension. Additionally, this exercise systolic BP above the thresholds was associated with greater left-ventricular mass index and aortic PWV. CONCLUSIONS: Submaximal exercise systolic BP is associated with masked hypertension and adverse cardiovascular structure in adolescents. Exercise BP may be useful in addition to clinic BP for screening of high BP and cardiovascular risk in adolescents.},

Contractile responses to dopamine (10(-7)-10(-3) M) in the presence of propranolol, cocaine, and 17 beta oestradiol were competitively antagonised by the alpha 2-selective adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (10(-8)-10(-6) M) but unaffected by the alpha 1 selective adrenoceptor antagonist doxazosin (10(-8)-10(-6) M), whereas the response to norepinephrine (NE) (10(-8)-10(-3) M) was antagonised by doxazosin (10(-8)-10(-6) M), thus demonstrating the presence of alpha 1-adrenoceptors in this preparation.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether celiprolol possesses a direct vasodilatory effect on human vasculature in vivo and in vitro. We studied the in vivo effects of intra-arterial celiprolol (1-100 micrograms/min i.a.) on forearm blood flow (FBF). Forearm blood was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography. Possible vasorelaxant actions of celiprolol on human vascular smooth muscle were studied using segments of isolated human saphenous vein in vitro. The effect of celiprolol was investigated on resting tone or noradrenaline induced tone. Possible alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist effects of celiprolol were assessed using celiprolol as an antagonist of BHT933 induced constriction. Celiprolol was without significant effect on FBF and failed to relax isolated saphenous vein segments preconstricted with noradrenaline. The weak alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist action of celiprolol was demonstrable in human saphenous vein. This study does not provide evidence for a direct vasodilatory effect of celiprolol on human vasculature.},

Possible involvement of vascular dopamine receptors and the renin-angiotensin system in the response to ANP was also studied in vivo. 2. Forearm blood blow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography. Isolated human blood vessels were studied using conventional organ bath techniques. 3. ANP (0.1-1 microgram/min, intra-arterially) produced a dose-dependent increase in forearm blood flow, corresponding to a 163% increase in net forearm blood flow in the study arm. This action of ANP was not antagonized by (R)-sulpiride (100 micrograms/min, intra-arterially), a selective vascular dopamine receptor antagonist, or 50 mg of oral captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme. 4. ANP (1 nmol/l-1 mumol/l) produced concentration-dependent relaxation of isolated human arteries, including brachial artery, but was without effect on isolated human saphenous vein. 5. ANP produces vasodilatation in vivo and relaxes isolated human arterial smooth muscle. This action of ANP may contribute to its reported hypotensive effects in vivo.},

In vivo, forearm blood flow was measured plethysmographically and in vitro isolated rings of human blood vessels from a variety of sites were used for tissue bath studies. Intra-arterial fenoldopam markedly increased forearm blood flow, this effect was antagonised by (R) sulpiride, a vascular dopamine (DA1) antagonist, but not by metoclopramide, a neuronal (DA2) antagonist, or by guanethidine, an adrenergic neurone blocking agent. In vitro, fenoldopam relaxed preconstricted human renal, mesenteric and lumbar arteries, but not saphenous vein in a concentration dependent manner. (RS) sulpiride and SCH 23390 competitively antagonised this effect. These studies demonstrate the presence of a vasodilatory vascular dopamine receptor in man both in vivo and in vitro.},

   abstract = {1. The effect of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-AB) on tone and intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) was examined in rabbit isolated ear arteries. Arteries were mounted in a myograph and loaded with the Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorescent indicator, fura-2, for concurrent measurements of isometric force and [Ca2+]i. 2. PDGF-AB contracted rabbit ear artery in a concentration-dependent manner. PDGF-AB induced tone was associated with a rise in [Ca2+]i. In the presence of noradrenaline, PDGF-AB induced a similar rise in [Ca2+]i but contraction in response to PDGF-AB in the presence of noradrenaline was increased compared with PDGF-AB alone. 3. PDGF-AB-induced rise in [Ca2+]i and tone were abolished by removal of extracellular Ca2+ (with addition of BAPTA, a Ca2+ chelator), and by preincubation with a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, (-)-202,791. Bistyrphostin, a selective inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, also inhibited PDGF-AB-induced tone, but had no effect on noradrenaline- or potassium-induced tone. 4. PDGF-AB contracts rabbit ear artery by increasing Ca2+ entry through voltage-operated calcium channels. This effect involves activation of a tyrosine kinase.},

The precise pattern of signals and their relative importance to a particular functional response depends on both cell type and differentiation state. Although the contractile and trophic effects of Ang II are often thought of as distinct responses it is increasingly difficult to differentiate them in terms of signalling pathways. Since vasoconstriction and abnormal growth are both features of circulatory diseases such as hypertension and atherosclerosis a better understanding of the signalling pathways responsible for the vasoconstrictor and trophic actions of this peptide may help define novel therapeutic targets in cardiovascular disease.},

   abstract = {People of South Asian descent have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes, but little is known about the microcirculation in South Asian people despite evidence that this plays an important role in the aetiology of CVD. We compared the retinal microcirculation in a population-based sample of 287 middle-aged adults (144 European 143 South Asian) matched for age and sex. Retinal photographs were taken and analysed using a validated semi-automated program and microvascular measures were compared. Blood pressure, anthropometry and fasting bloods were also measured. South Asians had significantly fewer arteriolar and venular vessels and bifurcations. Arterioles and venules were longer and venules were also more tortuous in South Asians. These differences were not explained by adjustment for traditional risk factors including blood pressure, body mass index, diabetes or measures of insulin resistance. People of South Asian descent have rarefaction of the retinal microcirculation compared to age-sex matched individuals of European descent. Reduced microvascular density could contribute to the elevated risk of CVD and impaired glucose tolerance in South Asian people.},

Angiotensin II, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) evoked a transient inward current in isolated single car artery cells of rabbit held at -60 mV by whole cell voltage clamp in physiological saline using a KCL-containing pipette solution. Under these conditions agonist did not activate a calcium-dependent potassium current. 2. Responses to each agonist were transient and desensitized rapidly. Inward current at -60 mV holding potential was not abolished by blockade of voltage-dependent calcium channels or by buffering intracellular calcium with BAPTA, a calcium chelator, or following depletion of intracellular calcium stores with ryanodine. 3. The shape of the current-voltage relationships and the reversal potentials of the current induced by angiotensin II, 5-HT and ATP were similar under a variety of ionic conditions. Agonist-induced current was unaffected by replacing intracellular chloride with citrate ions or by replacing intracellular sodium with caesium or extracellular sodium with barium or calcium. Replacement of extracellular sodium with Tris shifted the reversal potential in all cases by around 30 mV negatively. 4. These data suggest that angiotensin II, 5-HT and ATP activate similar cationic conductances which are relatively non-selective allowing mono- and divalent cations to cross the smooth muscle cell membrane. These channels may allow the influx of calcium under physiological conditions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maximum aerobic capacity (VO2max) is associated with lower cardiovascular and total mortality. Step tests can be used to provide an estimate of (VO2max) in epidemiological or home-based studies. We compared different methods of estimation of VO2max and heart rate recovery and evaluated the relationship of these estimates with cardiovascular risk factors. METHODS: Data were analysed from 2286 participants in the Tecumseh Community Health Study (>16y and <70y) who performed a step test. VO2max was estimated from heart rate using three methods and the results compared. The magnitude of heart rate recovery (HRR) and the time constant of recovery based on different time intervals post-exercise were also estimated. RESULTS: Estimated VO2max showed good or poor agreement depending on the method used. VO2max correlated inversely with systolic blood pressure (SBP), body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol, blood glucose following a 100g oral load (PLG) and Framingham risk score. In a multivariable model age sex, cigarette smoking, SBP, BMI and PLG were significantly inversely associated with VO2max. Correlations with risk factors were strongest for HRR measured over the first 30s of recovery. Only the time constant calculated from the 3 min post-exercise period correlated significantly with risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: The Tecumseh step test can be used to provide estimates of VO2max and heart rate recovery. Estimated VO2max was inversely associated with higher systolic BP, higher BMI and worse glucose tolerance. Measurements of HRR over the first 30s and the time constant calculate from the first 3 min of recovery correlate most closely with risk factors.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) play a role in the repair and regeneration of the endothelium and may represent a novel cardiovascular risk factor. South Asian subjects have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease which is not fully explained by known risk factors. This study examined associations of EPCs with atherosclerosis and possible ethnic differences in EPCs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A population sample of 58 European and South Asian adult men was enriched with the recruitment of an additional 59 European and South Asian men with known coronary disease. The coronary artery calcification score was measured by multi-slice computerized tomography (CT), carotid and femoral intima-media thickness (IMT), and femoral plaques were measured by ultrasound. The subjects were further subdivided into three categories of coronary artery disease on the basis of coronary artery calcification score and clinical history. Total EPCs and non-senescent EPCs (ns-EPCs) were quantified after 5 days cell culture and the number of late outgrowth colonies was measured over a 6-week test period. Circulating CD34+ haematopoietic precursor cells were measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Individuals with femoral plaques had reduced total and ns-EPCs. The number of ns-EPCs were reduced in individuals with the most coronary atheroma and were inversely related to the coronary calcification score and femoral IMT. These relationships persisted after multivariate adjustment for other risk factors. The numbers of late outgrowth colonies or circulating CD34+ cells were unrelated to the presence of atherosclerosis. There were no differences in the number of EPCs between European and South Asian subjects. CONCLUSION: The number of EPCs are reduced in subjects with atherosclerosis independent of other risk factors. Reduction in EPC numbers may be an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis but does not explain ethnic differences in cardiovascular risk.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Blood pressure (BP) is the leading global cause of mortality, and its prevalence is increasing in children and adolescents. Aortic BP is lower than brachial BP in adults. We aimed to assess the extent of this difference and its impact on the diagnosis of hypertension among adolescents. METHODS: We used data from 3850 participants from a UK cohort of births in the early 1990s in the Southwest of England, who attended their approximately 17-year follow-up and had valid measures of brachial and aortic BP at that clinic [mean (SD) age 17.8 (0.4) years, 66% female individuals]. Data are presented as mean differences [95% prediction intervals] for both sexes. RESULTS: Aortic systolic BP (SBP) was lower than brachial SBP [male, -22.3 (-31.2, -13.3) mmHg; female, -17.8 (-25.5, -10.0) mmHg]. Differences between aortic and brachial diastolic BP (DBP) were minimal. Based on brachial BP measurements, 101 male individuals (6%) and 22 female individuals (1%) were classified as hypertensive. In contrast, only nine male individuals (<1%) and 14 female individuals (<1%) met the criteria for hypertension based on aortic BP, and the predictive value of brachial BP for aortic hypertension was poor (positive-predictive value = 13.8%). Participants with aortic hypertension had a higher left ventricular mass index than those with brachial hypertension. CONCLUSION: Brachial BP substantially overestimates aortic BP in adolescents because of marked aortic-to-brachial pulse pressure amplification. The use of brachial BP measurement may result in an overdiagnosis of hypertension during screening in adolescence.},

   abstract = {Objectives: We characterised differences in BP control and use of antihypertensive medications in European (EA), South Asian (SA) and African-Caribbean (AC) people with hypertension and investigated the potential role of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), reduced arterial compliance (Ca), and antihypertensive medication use in any differences. Methods: Analysis was restricted to individuals with hypertension [age range 59-85 years; N = 852 (EA = 328, SA = 356, and AC =168)]. Questionnaires, anthropometry, BP measurements, echocardiography, and fasting blood assays were performed. BP control was classified according to UK guidelines operating at the time of the study. Data were analysed using generalised structural equation models, multivariable regression and treatment effect models. Results: SA and AC people were more likely to receive treatment for high BP and received a greater average number of antihypertensive agents, but despite this a smaller proportion of SA and AC achieved control of BP to target [age and sex adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 0.52 (0.38, 0.72) and 0.64 (0.43, 0.96), respectively]. Differences in BP control were partially attenuated by controlling for the higher prevalence of T2DM and reduced Ca in SA and AC. There was little difference in choice of antihypertensive agent by ethnicity and no evidence that differences in efficacy of antihypertensive regimens contributed to ethnic differences in BP control. Conclusions: T2DM and more adverse arterial stiffness are important factors in the poorer BP control in SA and AC people. More effort is required to achieve better control of BP, particularly in UK ethnic minorities.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Abnormalities of the retinal circulation may be associated with cerebrovascular disease. We investigated associations between retinal microvascular abnormalities and (1) strokes and subclinical cerebral infarcts and (2) cerebral white matter lesions in a UK-based triethnic population-based cohort. METHODS: A total of 1185 participants (age, 68.8+/-6.1 years; 77% men) underwent retinal imaging and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging. Cerebral infarcts and white matter hyperintensities were identified on magnetic resonance imaging, retinopathy was graded, and retinal vessels were measured. RESULTS: Higher retinopathy grade (odds ratio [OR], 1.40 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.16-1.70]), narrower arteriolar diameter (OR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.97-0.99]), fewer symmetrical arteriolar bifurcations (OR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.75-0.95]), higher arteriolar optimality deviation (OR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.00-1.34]), and more tortuous venules (OR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.09-1.32]) were associated with strokes/infarcts and white matter hyperintensities. Associations with quantitative retinal microvascular measures were independent of retinopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities of the retinal microvasculature are independently associated with stroke, cerebral infarcts, and white matter lesions.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Grading of hypertension severity by fundoscopic appearance is difficult and inaccurate. We investigated whether essential hypertension (EHT) and malignant phase hypertension (MHT) were associated with quantifiable abnormalities of the topology and architecture of the retinal circulation. METHODS: The topology and architecture of the retinal microvasculature were compared in images from 20 normotensive subjects, 20 patients with EHT and 20 patients with MHT. Digitized retinal photographs were analysed by a novel multiscale image analysis method using a semi-automated program to quantify geometrical and topological properties of arteriolar and venular trees. RESULTS: EHT was associated with an increase in the arteriolar length-to-diameter ratio (P < 0.01). There were also alterations in arteriolar topology indicative of rarefaction, including a marked reduction in the number of terminal branches in EHT (P < 0.01). These changes in the arteriolar network were exaggerated in MHT and there was also increased venular tortuosity and venular rarefaction in MHT compared with normotensive subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension is associated with marked topological alterations in the retinal vasculature, and quantification of these changes may be a useful novel approach to the assessment of target organ damage in hypertension.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Augmentation index (AIx) is widely used as a measure of wave reflection. We compared the relationship between AIx and age, height and sex with 'gold standard' measures of wave reflection derived from measurements of pressure and flow to establish how well AIx measures wave reflection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Measurements of carotid pressure and flow velocity were made in the carotid artery of 65 healthy normotensive individuals (age 21-78 yr; 43 male) and pulse wave analysis, wave intensity analysis and wave separation was performed; waveforms were classified into type A, B or C. AIx, the time of the first shoulder (T(s)), wave reflection index (WRI) and the ratio of backward to forward pressure (P(b)/P(f)) were calculated. RESULTS: AIx did not correlate with log WRI or P(b)/P(f). When AIx was restricted to positive values AIx and log WRI were positively correlated (r = 0.33; p = 0.04). In contrast log WRI and P(b)/P(f) were closely correlated (r = 0.66; p<0.001). There was no correlation between the T(s) and the timing of Pb or the reflected wave identified by wave intensity analysis. Wave intensity analysis showed that the morphology of type C waveforms (negative AIx) was principally due to a forward travelling (re-reflected) decompression wave in mid-systole. AIx correlated positively with age, inversely with height and was higher in women. In contrast log WRI and P(b)/P(f) showed negative associations with age, were unrelated to height and did not differ significantly by gender. CONCLUSIONS: AIx has serious limitations as a measure of wave reflection. Negative AIx values derived from Type C waves should not be used as estimates of wave reflection magnitude.},

We compared the effect of pioglitazone vs. placebo on left ventricular (LV) diastolic and systolic function in people with type 2 diabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS: 24 male or female patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to pioglitazone (45 mg/day) or placebo in addition to current therapy for 12 weeks using a prospective double blind crossover protocol following a run-in period >1 week and a 2 week washout period at crossover. Tissue Doppler early peak velocity (e'), a measure of LV diastolic function, was the primary outcome. Pioglitazone significantly increased e' by 0.7(0.1, 1.3) cm/s (mean (95% confidence interval); p=0.02) compared with placebo. Pioglitazone also increased E/A and mitral deceleration index, ejection fraction, stroke volume and weight, whereas fasting glucose, HbA1c, total peripheral resistance and LV meridional end systolic stress were decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with pioglitazone for 12 weeks improves left ventricular diastolic and systolic function in people with type 2 diabetes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Wave intensity analysis provides valuable information on ventriculo-arterial function, hemodynamics, and energy transfer in the arterial circulation. Widespread use of wave intensity analysis is limited by the need for concurrent measurement of pressure and flow waveforms. We describe a method that can estimate wave intensity patterns using only non-invasive pressure waveforms (pWIA). METHODS: Radial artery pressure and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) flow velocity waveforms were recorded in 12 participants in the Southall and Brent Revisited (SABRE) study. Pressure waveforms were analyzed using custom-written software to derive the excess pressure (P (xs) ) which was scaled to peak LVOT velocity and used to calculate wave intensity. These data were compared with wave intensity calculated using the measured LVOT flow velocity waveform. In a separate study, repeat measures of pWIA were performed on 34 individuals who attended two clinic visits at an interval of approximately 1 month to assess reproducibility and reliability of the method. RESULTS: P (xs) waveforms were similar in shape to aortic flow velocity waveforms and the time of peak P (xs) and peak aortic velocity agreed closely. Wave intensity estimated using pWIA showed acceptable agreement with estimates using LVOT velocity tracings and estimates of wave intensity were similar to values reported previously in the literature. The method showed fair to good reproducibility for most parameters. CONCLUSION: The P (xs) is a surrogate of LVOT flow velocity which, when appropriately scaled, allows estimation of aortic wave intensity with acceptable reproducibility. This may enable wider application of wave intensity analysis to large studies.},

PDGF-AB induced significantly greater [methyl3H]-thymidine uptake than PDGF-BB, and PDGF-AA was much less effective than either PDGF-AB or PDGF-BB. The effects of all three isoforms were inhibited by tyrphostin-23, a selective inhibitor of tyrosine kinases PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB increased [Ca2+]i, although the maximum response to PDGF-AB was significantly less than that to PDGF-BB. Both isoforms increased [Ca2+]i by stimulating influx and intracellular release of Ca2+. PDGF-AA had no measurable effect on [Ca2+]i. All three isoforms increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a 170-kDa protein detected by Western blotting. Quantitative densitometry indicated that PDGF-BB induced greater tyrosine phosphorylation than PDGF-AB and both PDGF-BB and PDGF-AB induced markedly more tyrosine phosphorylation than PDGF-AA. PDGF isoforms have differing efficacies in terms of DNA synthesis, Ca2+ mobilization, and tyrosine phosphorylation by human saphenous vein cells.},

   abstract = {The influx of calcium in response to vasopressin receptor stimulation is an important component of excitation-contraction coupling. We have examined the routes by which Ca2+ and other divalent cations enter vascular smooth muscle cells using a cultured vascular smooth muscle cell line (A7r5). Confluent A7r5 cells were loaded with Fura-2 to permit measurement of intracellular divalent cation concentration (Ca2+, Ba2+, Mn2+). Combinations of excitation wavelengths (340/380, 340/356, 356/380 and 340/370) were used depending on the divalent cation being studied. Emission was measured at 510 nm for all studies. Ca2+, Ba2+ and Mn2+ permeated unstimulated A7r5 cells. Vasopressin increased intracellular Ca2+ in cells both in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+, although responses in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ were smaller and had no sustained component. Amlodipine, a voltage-dependent calcium channel blocker, had no effect on Ca2+ entry, but Ni2+ did block Ca2+ influx. Vasopressin-induced elevations of intracellular Ca2+ in Ca(2+)-free physiological saline were abolished by ionomycin and thapsigargin. In the presence of extracellular Ba2+ vasopressin increased intracellular Ca2+ transiently and caused a small sustained increase in intracellular Ba2+ concentration. Ionomycin and thapsigargin increased intracellular Ca2+ but had no effect on Ba2+ influx. In contrast vasopressin, ionomycin and thapsigargin had no effect on Mn2+ influx. Econazole and SKF 96365, imidazoles reported to be blockers of receptor-induced cation entry, increased intracellular Ca2+ by releasing intracellular Ca2+ from a different site to that mobilized by vasopressin or thapsigargin in A7r5 cells. Econazole and SKF 96365 partially inhibited passive influx of Ca2+ and Ba2+ but did not inhibit passive influx of Mn2+, or vasopressin-induced influx of Ba2+. U73122, a putative inhibitor of phospholipase C partially inhibited passive entry of Ca2+ but not passive entry of Mn2+ and Ba2+. U73122 also inhibited vasopressin-induced release of intracellular Ca2+ and agonist-induced Ca2+ influx but did not block vasopressin-induced Ba2+ influx. Divalent cations enter A7r5 cells by a number of routes - 'passive' pathway(s) that admit Ca2+, Ba2+ and Mn2+ and receptor-operated pathway(s) that are permeable to Ca2+, Ba2+ but not Mn2+. On the basis of ionic permeabilities and the effect of various blocking agents, there appear to be two distinct passive influx routes. One is permeable to Ca2+ and Ba2+ and is blocked by econazole or SKF 96365. The other is permeable to Mn2+ and is blocked by Ni2+. There also appear to be two different routes of divalent cation entry involved in responses to receptor activation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Following induction of tone with a potassium depolarizing solution, dopamine in the presence of beta-adrenoceptor and catecholamine uptake blockade relaxed isolated omental and subcutaneous arteries. Preincubation of tissues with phentolamine increased the maximum relaxation in response to dopamine. 2. The selective vascular dopamine receptor agonists, fenoldopam and SKF 38393 also relaxed isolated subcutaneous and omental arteries in a concentration-dependent manner. The order of potency for agonists was dopamine greater than fenoldopam greater than SKF 38393. 3. Dopamine-induced relaxation was competitively antagonized by SCH 23390, (R)- and (S)-sulpiride, and fenoldopam induced relaxation by SCH 23390 and (+)- but not (-)-butaclamol. 4. These results indicate the presence of vascular dopamine receptors (DA1 subtype) on human isolated resistance arteries from omental and subcutaneous sites.},

Carotid intima-media thickness was measured bilaterally using a Duplex doppler ultrasonic scanner. In the hypertensive individuals the left ventricle was examined by echo-cardiography and the left ventricular mass index determined. There was a significant association between age and IMT, and both SBP and DBP and IMT. The IMT in the hypertensive group was significantly larger than in the normotensive group and in the hypertensive subjects there was a positive association between left ventricular mass index and IMT. There was no significant difference in calculated media stress between the normotensive and hypertensive groups, probably due to a small increase in carotid intima-media area combined with a small reduction in carotid lumen diameter. Hypertension is associated with a thickening of the intima-media of the carotid artery and an increase in left ventricular mass. Whether these changes in cardiac and arterial structure are in response to similar influences remains to be established.},

The carotid artery wall was visualized using a high resolution ultrasound technique in 37 untreated hypertensive patients (25 males, 12 females) and 37 age and sex matched normotensive individuals and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and carotid artery diameter measured. IMT and intima-media cross sectional area was significantly greater in the hypertensive group compared with the normotensive group, though the carotid artery diameter did not differ significantly. There was a significant association between age and IMT in both groups. In the hypertensive group there was also a significant association between left ventricular mass index, ventricular septal or posterior wall thickness and IMT. This study indicates that there is an association between cardiac and carotid arterial structure in hypertension. Such a relationship may be important in understanding the associated risks of high blood pressure.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Hypertension causes arteriolar narrowing and rarefaction in the retinal circulation, but the extent to which these changes are reversible by antihypertensive treatment is not well studied. We compared the effect of antihypertensive treatment with a calcium-channel-blocker-based regimen and an angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitor-based regimen on the retinal microvasculature. METHODS: Twenty-five patients (17 men, age range 24-71 years) with untreated hypertension were randomized to treatment with an amlodipine-based (n = 12) or lisinopril-based (n = 13) regimen in a double-blind, prospective parallel limb trial for 52 weeks. Measurements of blood pressure and the retinal microvasculature were made at baseline and at the end of the study. RESULTS: Both the amlodipine-based and lisinopril-based treatments reduced blood pressure to similar extents. Blood pressure reduction was associated with a reduction in arteriolar narrowing, a widening of arteriolar branch angle and an increase in arteriolar density. There were no significant differences between the two treatment regimens. CONCLUSION: Antihypertensive treatment is associated with improvement in arteriolar narrowing and rarefaction. Improved microvascular structure may contribute to the beneficial effects of antihypertensive treatment in hypertension.},

   abstract = {Ring segments of splanchnic, peripheral, coronary, pulmonary and uterine conduit arteries obtained during surgery were studied in tissue baths. Resistance arteries dissected from various sites were studied in a myograph. Both conduit and resistance vessels contracted in response to the alpha 1-agonist phenylephrine (10(-7) to 10(-4) mol/l), an effect that was antagonized by the alpha 1-antagonist doxazosin (10(-8) to 10(-6) mol/l). However, the alpha 2-agonists BHT 933 (10(-7) to 10(-4) mol/l) and UK 14304 (10(-7) to 10(-4) mol/l) only contracted the resistance vessels and not the conduit arteries. The response to BHT 933 was competitively antagonized by the alpha 2-antagonist yohimbine (3.10(-8) to 3.10(-7) mol/l) and the magnitude of the contractile response was inversely related to vessel size. Similarly, neuropeptide Y (10(-9) to 10(-6) mol/l) contracted only the resistance vessels, and induced marked tachyphylaxis. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP; 10(-8) to 10(-6) mol/l) produced concentration-dependent relaxation in all conduit arteries studied, being ineffective in resistance arteries from subcutaneous or omental sites, but relaxed those from renal tissue and skeletal muscle. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (10(-8) to 10(-6) mol/l) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (10(-9) to 10(-6) mol/l) relaxed both conduit and resistance arteries. This response was dependent on the integrity of the endothelium in the systemic conduit but not the resistance vessels. These results indicate that the receptors for adrenergic agonists and vasoactive peptides are varyingly distributed throughout the human vasculature.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

ET-1 (10 pM-10 nM) contracted isolated human subcutaneous and omental resistance vessels. Contractile responses to ET-1 were sustained and washout recovery was slow. Responses to ET-1 displayed marked tachyphylaxis. Calcium channel blockers and removal of extracellular calcium failed to completely abolish responses to ET-1 in vitro.},

Forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured using venous occlusion plethysmography in normal volunteers. Intra-arterial (i.a.) dopamine alone produced variable and small changes in FBF. However, following alpha-adrenoceptor blockade with phenoxybenzamine, dopamine infusion resulted in forearm vasodilatation in the infused arm. This effect was not antagonized by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, but was antagonized by the vascular dopamine receptor antagonist, sulpiride, the (d) enantiomer being more active than the (l). It is concluded that i.a. dopamine induces forearm vasodilatation following alpha-adrenoceptor blockade by an action on vascular dopamine (DA1) receptors similar to those described in the renal and mesenteric vasculature of other species.},

   abstract = {1. Amlodipine, a dihydropyridine derivative largely ionized at physiological pH, inhibited calcium channel currents in single vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from rabbit ear artery in a concentration-dependent manner. 2. Amlodipine inhibited the current-voltage relationship for calcium channel currents across the range of test potentials used. However, the effect of amlodipine was more marked on more depolarized test potentials. Amlodipine also shifted the steady-state inactivation curve for calcium channel currents in a hyperpolarized direction. 3. The potency of amlodipine as determined from the steady-state inhibition of calcium channel current induced by the drug was dependent on the holding potential of the cells. Use of a more depolarized holding potential increased the potency of amlodipine. 4. Onset of amlodipine-induced inhibition was relatively rapid at both -60 mV and -40 mV holding potential. The use of a more depolarized holding potential increased the rate of association of amlodipine. No recovery from amlodipine-induced inhibition was seen over a 20 min period following washout of the drug. 5. In addition to voltage-dependence, the action of amlodipine showed use-dependence, in that the effect of amlodipine was more marked when calcium channel currents were evoked frequently. Increasing the frequency of activation of calcium channel currents did not alter the apparent onset rate of amlodipine-induced inhibition, but increased the degree of inhibition achieved by the drug. 6. The electrophysiological properties of amlodipine, particularly its voltage-dependence are probably important determinants of its action in vivo.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that changes in the retinal microvasculature predict cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, little is known regarding influences on the retinal microvasculature in healthy people without overt cardiovascular or metabolic disease. METHODS: We used a semiautomated computerized technique to analyze digitized retinal photographs from a total of 167 healthy people (age range, 45-75 years; 83 female), without clinical CVD, diabetes, or hypertension, randomly sampled from the population-based Beaver Dam Eye Study. We assessed arteriolar and venular narrowing, arteriolar optimality deviation, and other quantitative aspects of the retinal microvasculature. RESULTS: Arterioles were significantly narrower and longer, had wider branching angles, and were more tortuous than venules. Increased arteriolar length to diameter ratio (an index of ratio arteriolar narrowing) was positively and independently associated with older age and elevated systolic blood pressure. Arteriolar optimality deviation (an index of microvascular endothelial dysfunction) increased with greater body mass index. Current smoking and increased white blood cell (WBC) count was associated with wider venules. After controlling for smoking, WBC was no longer a significant predictor of venular diameter. CONCLUSIONS: CVD risk factors are associated with retinal microvascular changes in healthy individuals without evidence of CVD, diabetes, or hypertension. CVD risk factors have different influences on the arteriolar and venular bed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that most excess weight gain occurs by school entry in a large sample of English children, and to determine when the greatest gain in excess weight occurred between birth and 15 years. METHODS: Longitudinal data were collected annually from birth to 15 years in 625 children. Weight and BMI at each time point were expressed relative to UK 1990 growth reference as z scores. Excess weight gain was calculated as the group increase in weight and BMI z scores between specific time periods. RESULTS: Weight z score did not increase from birth to 5 years (mean difference: 0.04 [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.03-0.12] P = .30) but increased from 5 to 9 years (mean difference: 0.19 [95% CI: 0.14-0.23] P < .001). BMI z score increased from 7 to 9 years (mean difference: 0.22 [95% CI: 0.18-0.26] P < .001), with no evidence of a large increase before 7 years and after 9 years. CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support the hypothesis that most excess weight gain occurs in early childhood in contemporary English children. Excess weight gain was substantial in mid-childhood, with more gradual increases in early childhood and adolescence, which indicates that interventions to prevent excess weight should focus on school-aged children and adolescents as well as the preschool years.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that preterm birth and being born SGA would be associated with changes in retinal microvascular architecture and that these changes would be more marked among those born preterm. We further hypothesized that these microvascular changes would correlate with early markers of CVD in mid-adulthood. METHODS: The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study included randomly selected children from 5 Finnish University cities. Retinal microvascular architecture of participants born preterm, born at term and SGA and a control group born at term and AGA were compared (aged 34-49 years). RESULTS: In participants born preterm, arteriolar tortuosity (x10(2)) was higher-means (standard error), 0.06 (0.01) versus 0.04 (0.01), p = 0.001, arteriolar length (pixels) were greater-644.9 (35.9) versus 591.7 (33.5), p = 0.007 and arteriolar diameters (pixels) were narrower-19.9 (0.4) versus 20.3 (0.3), p = 0.034 compared to participants born AGA, after adjustment. In participants born SGA, only arteriolar tortuosity was higher-0.05 (0.01) versus 0.04 (0.01), p = 0.074 compared to participants born AGA. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that being born SGA and in particular preterm birth are associated with changes in retinal microvascular architecture. The prenatal and immediate postnatal environment may contribute to the mechanisms.},

In both WKY and SHR strains, highly significant correlations between CABP and TCBP were found and Bland-Altman analyses showed no bias when the two methods were compared. The limits of agreement between CABP and TCBP in WKY and SHR were wide and reproducibility of pressure measurements by either technique was poor, with some evidence for strain-dependent differences. Pressure measurements made over short time frames, however, showed close agreement between CABP and TCBP. Acetylcholine-induced reductions in pressure were equivalently detected by tail-cuff and direct arterial measurement in both strains but angiotensin II-induced pressure elevations were over-estimated by tail-cuff in SHR. Telemetered SBP measurements in conscious rats were highly variable in a strain-dependent manner.},

Endogenous polyamines (putrescine, spermidine and spermine) have an essential role in cellular growth and may be required in vascular restructuring. We have previously shown raised polyamines in resistance vessels in response to angiotensin II (angII) infusion in the rat and here we examined whether polyamine depletion influences the hypertensive process. Wistar-Kyoto rats were infused with either angII or saline by osmotic minipump, and maintained on either 2% difluoromethylornithine (DFMO; polyamine synthesis inhibitor) or water for 12 days. AngII significantly increased tail-cuff blood pressure (bp), resistance vessel spermidine and spermine concentration, and media:lumen ratios. DFMO attenuated both the rise in bp (p < 0.05) and vascular spermidine (p < 0.05) in the angII infused rats but vascular structure was apparently unaffected on day 12. In conclusion, raised concentration of resistance vessel spermidine may be a necessary component of the ang II pressor effect.},

Hypertension is associated with structural modifications of the circulatory system, a process that may be facilitated by polyamines. In this study, we examined whether there are elevated polyamine concentrations in the cardiovascular tissues of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) relative to Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. We also determined the chronic effect of 2% difluoromethylornithine (DFMO; a polyamine biosynthesis inhibitor) on tissue polyamines and hypertension. 2. SHR and WKY rats were treated with either 2% DFMO or drug-free drinking water; blood pressure was measured on alternate days and tissue polyamines were analysed at the end of the study. 3. We found that spermidine and spermine concentrations were markedly raised in the ventricles, resistance vessels and liver of the SHR, in comparison with corresponding tissues of WKY rats. DFMO did not affect SHR resistance vessel and liver polyamines, although spermidine in the ventricles was reduced. The blood pressure of neither SHR nor WKY rats was affected by DFMO. 4. In conclusion, this study shows for the first time a raised concentration of polyamines in the resistance vasculature of the SHR, in relation to their normotensive counterparts. The inability of DFMO to significantly reduce tissue polyamines in this study is in contrast to the effectiveness of 2% DFMO in other hypertension models, suggesting that polyamine homeostasis in this model may be stringently regulated.},

   abstract = {Angiotensin II (Ang II), an effector peptide of the renin-angiotensin system, has been reported to stimulate growth of blood vessels in vivo and smooth muscle cells in culture. In this study, the effect of Ang II on DNA synthesis was examined in deendothelialized human saphenous vein in organ culture. After 7 days' exposure to medium containing 0.4% fetal calf serum plus Ang II, there was a marked increase in DNA synthesis. The effect of Ang II was comparable to the response to platelet-derived growth factor. Responses to Ang II were partially inhibited by the AT(1) receptor antagonist candesartan. An AT(2) receptor antagonist, PD123319, had no effect on Ang II-induced DNA synthesis, either alone or in combination with candesartan. The Ang II peptide analogues [Sar(1), Ile(8)]-Ang II (saralasin) and [Sar(1),Thr(8)]-Ang II (sarthran) acted as agonists, increasing DNA synthesis. In the presence of saralasin, responses to Ang II were inhibited. Tyrphostin-23, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, prevented Ang II-induced DNA synthesis and reduced DNA synthesis in tissues incubated in medium containing only 0.4% fetal calf serum. In conclusion, Ang II stimulates DNA synthesis in human saphenous vein in organ culture. The effect of Ang II was more marked than has been previously reported in isolated cultured saphenous vein smooth muscle cells, and this effect is mediated in part by an angiotensin type 1 receptor. It is possible that an undefined receptor for Ang II may also be involved in the stimulation of DNA synthesis in this preparation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the involvement of polyamines in the development of cardiovascular hypertrophy in a rat angiotensin II infusion model of hypertension. METHODS: Rats were chronically infused with a low dose of angiotensin II (83 ng.min-1.rat-1) or vehicle by osmotic minipumps. The polyamine content of the cardiovascular organs and liver was measured by HPLC, and the blood pressure of conscious rats was determined by a tail cuff method. The mesenteric arterial beds were perfusion fixed in situ and medial and luminal cross sectional areas were determined by computer assisted planimetry. Cardiac hypertrophy was assessed by determination of ventricular:body weight ratios. RESULTS: Angiotensin II infusion caused an increased concentration of polyamines in the ventricles and aorta within hours of beginning the infusion, and within days in the mesenteric arteries. Polyamine content of the liver was unaffected. Hypertrophy of the myocardium and mesenteric arteries in association with the increased blood pressure was evident. CONCLUSIONS: A low dose of angiotensin II stimulates an early biochemical marker of growth, the polyamines, in cardiovascular tissues but not in the liver. The increase in tissue polyamines is associated with cardiovascular hypertrophy and the development of hypertension.},

   abstract = {1. Although the fixed combination preparations of thiazide and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor are gaining wide acceptance in clinical practice, data on the basic pharmacology of the combinations are relatively limited. The long-term structural and functional effects of a fixed low dose (0.24 + 0.76 mg/kg per day) combination of indapamide + perindopril (I + P,S5590) is spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were examined in the present study. 2. Male SHR (10-12 weeks) were treated with I + P or vehicle for 8 weeks. The blood pressure and heart rate were monitored by weekly measurements. At the end of the treatment period, left ventricular, aortic and intramyocardial coronary arteriole structures were assessed. Contractile and relaxant properties of mesenteric arteries were determined by wire-myography. 3. Indapamide + perindopril combination caused a significant lowering of both systolic (P < 0.001) and diastolic (P < 0.001) blood pressures. Left ventricle plus septum:bodyweight ratio (P < 0.001), aortic medial cross-sectional area (P < 0.05) and media:lumen ratios (P < 0.005) were all significantly reduced by I + P treatment. In contrast, the effect of I + P on intramyocardial coronary vascular structure did not reach statistical significance. There was some improvement in endothelium-independent vasorelaxation of mesenteric vessels but contractile responses to noradrenaline and calcium were unaffected by treatment. 4. In summary, a low dose I + P combination treatment of SHR partly normalizes both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Cardiac and larger vessel hypertrophy was reversed but intramyocardial coronary arteriole structure was not as readily regressed by the end of the study.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Large differences exist in the burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) between Russia and Western European countries including Norway. Obesity prevalence may contribute to the differences. We investigated whether difference in the level of adiposity, assessed using body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio(WHR), could explain intercountry differences in the burden of carotid plaque, a measure of atherosclerosis, in the populations. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. Logistic and linear regression models were used. SETTING: We used population-based cross-sectional Know Your Heart (KYH) study in Russia and the Tromso 7 study (Tromso 7) in Norway. PARTICIPANTS: 3262 and 1800 men and women aged 40-69 years in KYH and Tromso 7, respectively. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME: The presence of carotid plaques and plaque score assessed using ultrasound. RESULTS: The presence of carotid plaques and plaque score were higher in KYH than Tromso 7 regardless of age group and sex. A positive association between carotid plaque burden and adiposity was found (OR of having at least one plaque per SD in WHR 1.18 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.31) for men; 1.15 (1.06 to 1.25) for women)) adjusted for age, smoking and education in a pooled analysis of the two studies. There was little evidence of the interaction between study and adiposity. These effects did not differ between the two studies. However, neither adiposity nor CVD risk factors (smoking, systolic blood pressure, cholesterol, glycosylated haemoglobin) explained the higher carotid plaque burden in KYH compared with Tromso 7. CONCLUSION: Adiposity, especially abdominal adiposity, is a risk factor for carotid plaque in Russia and Norway, although neither adiposity nor established CVD risk factors explained the higher plaque burden in Russia. To reduce the CVD burden in Russia, beyond prevention and treatment of adiposity, further research is required to understand why Russia has a high burden of atherosclerosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few reports are available on the contribution of general and abdominal obesity to the progression of carotid atherosclerosis in late adulthood. This study investigated the impact of four simple anthropometric measures of general and abdominal obesity on the progression of carotid atherosclerosis and the extent to which the association between adiposity and the progression of plaque burden is mediated by cardiometabolic markers. METHODS: Four thousand three hundred forty-five adults (median age 60) from the population-based Tromso Study were followed over 7 years from the first carotid ultrasound screening to the next. The progression of carotid atherosclerosis was measured in three ways: incidence of plaques in previously plaque-free participants; change in the number of plaques; and total plaque area (TPA). We used generalised linear models to investigate the association between each adiposity measure - body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) - and each outcome. Models were adjusted for potential confounders (age, sex, smoking, education, physical activity). The pathways through which any associations observed might operate were investigated by further adjusting for cardiometabolic mediators (systolic blood pressure, cholesterol, and HbA1c). RESULTS: There was little evidence that adiposity was related to the formation of new plaques during follow-up. However, abdominal adiposity was associated with TPA progression. WHtR showed the largest effect size (mean change in TPA per one standard deviation (SD) increase in WHtR of 0.665 mm(2), 95% confidence interval 0.198, 1.133) while BMI showed the smallest. Effect sizes were substantially reduced after the adjustment for potential mediators. CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal obesity indirectly measured with WC seems more strongly associated with the progression of TPA than general obesity. These associations appear to be largely mediated by known cardiometabolic markers.},

   abstract = {AIMS: The aims of this study were to assess prescription patterns, dosages, discontinuation rates, and association with prognosis of conventional heart failure medications in patients with transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA). METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients diagnosed with ATTR-CA at the National Amyloidosis Centre between 2000 and 2022 identified 2371 patients with ATTR-CA. Prescription of heart failure medications was greater among patients with a more severe cardiac phenotype, comprising beta-blockers in 55.4%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis)/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in 57.4%, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) in 39.0% of cases. During a median follow-up of 27.8 months (interquartile range 10.6-51.3), 21.7% had beta-blockers discontinued, and 32.9% had ACEi/ARBs discontinued. In contrast, only 7.5% had MRAs discontinued. A propensity score-matched analysis demonstrated that treatment with MRAs was independently associated with a reduced risk of mortality in the overall population [hazard ratio (HR) 0.77 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66-0.89), P < .001] and in a pre-specified subgroup of patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >40% [HR 0.75 (95% CI 0.63-0.90), P = .002]; and treatment with low-dose beta-blockers was independently associated with a reduced risk of mortality in a pre-specified subgroup of patients with a LVEF </=40% [HR 0.61 (95% CI 0.45-0.83), P = .002]. No convincing differences were found for treatment with ACEi/ARBs. CONCLUSION: Conventional heart failure medications are currently not widely prescribed in ATTR-CA, and those that received medication had more severe cardiac disease. Beta-blockers and ACEi/ARBs were often discontinued, but low-dose beta-blockers were associated with reduced risk of mortality in patients with a LVEF </=40%. In contrast, MRAs were rarely discontinued and were associated with reduced risk of mortality in the overall population; but these findings require confirmation in prospective randomized controlled trials.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Microcirculatory abnormalities precede the onset of hypertension and may explain its familial nature. We examined the relationship between parental blood pressure (BP) and offspring retinal microvasculature in Pakistani trios [father, mother, and child (aged 9-14 years)]. METHODS: This is a substudy of a population-based trial of BP reduction. Data were available on 358 normotensive, and 410 offspring of at least one hypertensive parent. Retinal vessel characteristics were measured from digital images. Multivariable linear regression models were built to assess the associations between maternal and paternal BP and offspring retinal microvasculature. RESULTS: Optimality deviation was greatest in offspring of two hypertensive parents, compared with those with one or no hypertensive parent (P=0.030 for trend). Paternal SBP and DBP were each significantly associated with optimality deviation in offspring (P=0.023 and P=0.006, respectively). This relationship persisted after accounting for offspring cardiovascular risk factors [increase in optimality deviation (95% confidence interval, CI) 0.0053 (0.0001-0.0106, P=0.047) and 0.0109 (0.0025-0.0193, P=0.011), for each 10 mmHg increase in paternal SBP and DBP, respectively]. Maternal DBP was inversely associated with offspring arteriovenous ratio -0.0102 (-0.0198 to -0.0007, P=0.035). CONCLUSION: Microvascular endothelial dysfunction in children is associated with increasing levels of parental hypertension. The association with paternal BP is independent of other cardiovascular risk factors, including the child's BP. Higher maternal DBP is associated with evidence of arteriolar narrowing in offspring. These early microcirculatory changes may help explain familial predisposition to hypertension in people of Pakistani origin at an early age. VIDEO ABSTRACT: :},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to major economic disruptions. In March 2020, the UK implemented the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme - known as furlough - to minimize the impact of job losses. We investigate associations between change in employment status and mental and social wellbeing during the early stages of the pandemic. METHODS: Data were from 25,670 respondents, aged 17-66, across nine UK longitudinal studies. Furlough and other employment changes were defined using employment status pre-pandemic and during the first lockdown (April-June 2020). Mental and social wellbeing outcomes included psychological distress, life satisfaction, self-rated health, social contact, and loneliness. Study-specific modified Poisson regression estimates, adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics and pre-pandemic mental and social wellbeing, were pooled using meta-analysis. Associations were also stratified by sex, age, education, and household composition. RESULTS: Compared to those who remained working, furloughed workers were at greater risk of psychological distress (adjusted risk ratio, ARR = 1.12; 95%CI: 0.97, 1.29), low life satisfaction (ARR = 1.14; 95%CI: 1.07, 1.22), loneliness (ARR = 1.12; 95%CI: 1.01, 1.23), and poor self-rated health (ARR = 1.26; 95%CI: 1.05, 1.50). Nevertheless, compared to furloughed workers, those who became unemployed had greater risk of psychological distress (ARR = 1.30; 95%CI: 1.12, 1.52), low life satisfaction (ARR = 1.16; 95%CI: 0.98, 1.38), and loneliness (ARR = 1.67; 95%CI: 1.08, 2.59). Effects were not uniform across all sub-groups. CONCLUSIONS: During the early stages of the pandemic, those furloughed had increased risk of poor mental and social wellbeing, but furloughed workers fared better than those who became unemployed, suggesting that furlough may have partly mitigated poorer outcomes.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of exercise intolerance and persistent fatigue which can follow an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus ("long COVID") is not fully understood. Cases were recruited from a long COVID clinic (N = 32; 44 +/- 12 years; 10 (31%) men), and age-/sex-matched healthy controls (HC) (N = 19; 40 +/- 13 years; 6 (32%) men) from University College London staff and students. We assessed exercise performance, lung and cardiac function, vascular health, skeletal muscle oxidative capacity, and autonomic nervous system (ANS) function. Key outcome measures for each physiological system were compared between groups using potential outcome means (95% confidence intervals) adjusted for potential confounders. Long COVID participant outcomes were compared to normative values. When compared to HC, cases exhibited reduced oxygen uptake efficiency slope (1847 (1679, 2016) vs. 2176 (1978, 2373) mL/min, p = 0.002) and anaerobic threshold (13.2 (12.2, 14.3) vs. 15.6 (14.4, 17.2) mL/kg/min, p < 0.001), and lower oxidative capacity, measured using near infrared spectroscopy (tau: 38.7 (31.9, 45.6) vs. 24.6 (19.1, 30.1) s, p = 0.001). In cases, ANS measures fell below normal limits in 39%. Long COVID is associated with reduced measures of exercise performance and skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in the absence of evidence of microvascular dysfunction, suggesting mitochondrial pathology. There was evidence of attendant ANS dysregulation in a significant proportion. These multisystem factors might contribute to impaired exercise tolerance in long COVID sufferers.},

   abstract = {Exercise capacity is a strong independent predictor of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. The utilization of well-established submaximal tests of exercise capacity such as the 6-min walk test (6MWT), 3-min step test (3MST) and 10-chair rise test (10CRT) in the community would improve patient care but requires remote monitoring technology. Consumer grade smartwatches provide such an opportunity, however, their accuracy in measuring physiological responses to these tests is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of consumer grade smartwatches in assessing exercise capacity to develop a framework for remote, unsupervised testing. 16 healthy adults (7 male (44%), age median 27 [interquartile range (IQR) 26,29] years) performed 6MWTs using two protocols: (1) standard-straight 30 m laps (6MWT-standard) and 2) continuous lap-circular 240 m laps around a park (6MWT-continuous lap), 3MSTs and 10CRTs. Each one of these four tests was performed three times across two clinic visits. Each participant was fitted with a Garmin Vivoactive4 and Fitbit Sense smartwatch to measure three parameters: distance, step counts and heart rate (HR) response. Reference measures were a meter-wheel, hand tally counter and ECG, respectively. Mean HR was measured at rest, peak exercise and recovery. Agreement was measured using Bland-Altman analysis for repeated measures and summarized as median absolute percentage errors (MAPE). Distance during 6MWT-continuous lap had better agreement than during 6MWT-standard for both Garmin (MAPE: 6.4% [3.0, 10.4%] versus 20.1% [13.9, 28.4%], p < 0.001) and Fitbit (8.0% [2.9, 10.1% versus 18.8% [15.2, 28.1%], p < 0.001). Garmin measured step count more accurately than Fitbit (MAPE: 1.8% [0.9, 2.9%] versus 8.0% [2.6, 12.3%], p < 0.001). Irrespective of test, both devices showed excellent accuracy in measuring HR at rest and recovery (</= 3%), while accuracy decreased during peak exercise (Fitbit: ~ 12% and Garmin: ~ 7%). In young adults without mobility difficulties, exercise capacity can be measured remotely using standardized tests and consumer grade smartwatches.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The pathogenesis of the long-lasting symptoms which can follow an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus ('long covid') is not fully understood. The 'COroNaVirus post-Acute Long-term EffectS: Constructing an evidENCE base' (CONVALESCENCE) study was established as part of the Longitudinal Health and Wellbeing COVID-19 UK National Core Study. We performed a deep phenotyping case-control study nested within two cohorts (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children and TwinsUK) as part of CONVALESCENCE. PARTICIPANTS: From September 2021 to May 2023, 349 participants attended the CONVALESCENCE deep phenotyping clinic at University College London. Four categories of participants were recruited: cases of long covid (long covid(+)/SARS-CoV-2(+)), alongside three control groups: those with neither long covid symptoms nor evidence of prior COVID-19 (long covid(-)/SARS-CoV-2(-); control group 1), those who self-reported COVID-19 and had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but did not report long covid (long covid(-)/SARS-CoV-2(+); control group 2) and those who self-reported persistent symptoms attributable to COVID-19 but no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (long covid(+)/SARS-CoV-2(-); control group 3). Remote wearable measurements were performed up until February 2024. FINDINGS TO DATE: This cohort profile describes the baseline characteristics of the CONVALESCENCE cohort. Of the 349 participants, 141 (53+/-15 years old; 21 (15%) men) were cases, 89 (55+/-16 years old; 11 (12%) men) were in control group 1, 75 (49+/-15 years old; 25 (33%) men) were in control group 2 and 44 (55+/-16 years old; 9 (21%) men) were in control group 3. FUTURE PLANS: The study aims to use a multiorgan score calculated as the cumulative total for each of nine domains (ie, lung, vascular, heart, kidney, brain, autonomic function, muscle strength, exercise capacity and physical performance). The availability of data preceding acute COVID-19 infection in cohorts may help identify the consequences of infection independent of pre-existing subclinical disease and also provide evidence of determinants that influence the development of long covid.},

   abstract = {In activated rat mesenteric small arteries, the effect of pHi on force, membrane potential, and free cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i) was assessed. Arteries were mounted in a myograph for isometric force development, and [Ca2+]i, pHi, or membrane potential was measured simultaneously with force. During activation with norepinephrine, potassium, aluminum fluoride (AlF-4), and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, a phorbol ester), the vessels depolarized and [Ca2+]i increased, although the ratio of force to [Ca2+]i was less during potassium activation than with the other types of activation. Changes in pHi, with a constant pHo, were induced with NH4Cl or by changing PCO2. In resting vessels, the effects of the changes in pHi on tension, membrane potential, and [Ca2+]i were negligible. In vessels activated with norepinephrine or AlF-4, alkalinization caused an acute decrease of tone, which could be explained by a decrease in [Ca2+]i consequent to repolarization of the membrane. In vessels activated with potassium or PMA, the effects of alkalinization were smaller. This is consistent with acute alkalinization, affecting steps proximal in the excitation-contraction coupling distal to activation of G proteins. Acidification caused a transient increase in tone and [Ca2+]i, irrespective of the mode of stimulation, without affecting the membrane potential. Ryanodine did not abolish the transient increase in tone and [Ca2+]i. Thus, acute intracellular acidification may induce tone by release of an intracellular ryanodine-insensitive calcium pool or by affecting transmembranal calcium flux although in a membrane potential-independent way.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The identification and measurement of aortic aneurysms is an important clinical problem. While specialized high-resolution 3D CMR sequences allow detailed aortic assessment, they are time-consuming which limits their use in screening routine cardiac scans and in population studies. METHODS: A 3D U-Net, U-Net(LR,) was used to create 3D isotropic segmentations of the aorta from standard anisotropic 2D trans-axial localizers with low through-plane resolution. Training data was generated from high-resolution 3D isotropic whole heart images by simulating anisotropic images that resemble the low-resolution 2D localizers (the inputs). These inputs were paired with 3D isotropic 'ground truth' segmentation masks (the targets) created by a clinician from the high-resolution isotropic images. Segmentation quality was evaluated using an external dataset from UK Biobank. Segmentation accuracy was measured against ground-truth segmentations from concurrently acquired cardiac-triggered, respiratory-gated, high-resolution 3D isotropic whole heart images. Finally, the proposed method was compared to U-Net(HR), a 3D U-Net variant trained directly on high-resolution 3D isotropic images. A second observer was recruited to investigate the interobserver variability. RESULTS: Qualitative validation on an external dataset (UK Biobank) of 180 subjects showed that 93 % of 3D segmentations with the proposed model (U-Net(LR)) were considered suitable for clinical use. In quantitative analysis, the proposed method (U-Net(LR)) showed good agreement with ground-truth segmentations from isotropic 3D images with a mean DICE score of 0.9, which is no difference from automated segmentations made directly on the high-resolution 3D isotropic aorta images (U-Net(HR)). When comparing measurements, there is no significant difference between U-Net(LR,) U-Net(HR) and two clinical observers in the diameter measurements at the mid ascending aorta, mid aortic arch, and descending aorta. CONCLUSIONS: A new method of producing isotropic 3D aortic segmentations from routine CMR 2D anisotropic localizers shows good agreement with segmentation made directly from 3D isotropic images. The method has the potential to be used as a simple screening method for aortic aneurysms without the need for additional sequences.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Atherosclerosis begins early in life and obesity is a key determinant. We investigated the role of body mass index (BMI) and height from infancy to adulthood in presenting with high adulthood carotid intima-media thickness. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Odds ratios of BMI, and height Z scores at 2, 4, 6, 7, 11, 15, and 20 years, and changes between 2 and 4, 4 and 7, 7 and 15, and 15 and 20 years, for carotid intima-media thickness at 60 to 64 years in the upper quartile were estimated for 604 men and 669 women. Confounding by early-life environments, mediating by body size and cardiometabolic measures at 60 to 64 years, and effect modification were investigated. In men, there was positive association of BMI at 4 years (odds ratio, 1.256; 95% confidence interval, 1.026-1.538) and 20 years (1.282; 1.022-1.609), negative association of height at 4 years (0.780; 0.631-0.964), and negative association of height growth between 2 and 4 years (0.698; 0.534-0.913) with high carotid intima-media thickness. The childhood estimates were robust, but the estimate for BMI at 20 years was attenuated by adjustment for BMI at 60 to 64 years. The protective influence of greater early childhood height was strongest in those with the lowest systolic blood pressure at 60 to 64 years. In women, there was no pattern of association and all confidence intervals crossed 1. CONCLUSIONS: Early childhood in men might be a sensitive developmental period for atherosclerosis, in which changes in BMI and height represent 2 distinct biological mechanisms. The maintenance of healthy weight in men from adolescence onward may be a useful strategy to avoid the atherosclerotic complications of adiposity tracking.},

   abstract = {Social disadvantage across the life course is associated with a greater risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and with established CHD risk factors, but less is known about whether novel CHD risk factors show the same patterns. The Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development was used to investigate associations between occupational socioeconomic position during childhood, early adulthood and middle age and markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6), endothelial function (E-selectin, tissue-plasminogen activator), adipocyte function (leptin, adiponectin) and pancreatic beta cell function (proinsulin) measured at 60-64 years. Life course models representing sensitive periods, accumulation of risk and social mobility were compared with a saturated model to ascertain the nature of the relationship between social class across the life course and each of these novel CHD risk factors. For interleukin-6 and leptin, low childhood socioeconomic position alone was associated with high risk factor levels at 60-64 years, while for C-reactive protein and proinsulin, cumulative effects of low socioeconomic position in both childhood and early adulthood were associated with higher (adverse) risk factor levels at 60-64 years. No associations were observed between socioeconomic position at any life period with either endothelial marker or adiponectin. Associations for C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, leptin and proinsulin were reduced considerably by adjustment for body mass index and, to a lesser extent, cigarette smoking. In conclusion, socioeconomic position in early life is an important determinant of several novel CHD risk factors. Body mass index may be an important mediator of these relationships.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Continuous wave near infrared spectroscopy (CW NIRS) provides non-invasive technology to measure relative changes in oxy- and deoxy-haemoglobin in a dynamic environment. This allows determination of local skeletal muscle O2 saturation, muscle oxygen consumption ([Formula: see text]) and blood flow. This article provides a brief overview of the use of CW NIRS to measure exercise-limiting factors in skeletal muscle. RECENT FINDINGS: NIRS parameters that measure O2 delivery and capacity to utilise O2 in the muscle have been developed based on response to physiological interventions and exercise. NIRS has good reproducibility and agreement with gold standard techniques and can be used in clinical populations where muscle oxidative capacity or oxygen delivery (or both) are impaired. CW NIRS has limitations including: the unknown contribution of myoglobin to the overall signals, the impact of adipose tissue thickness, skin perfusion during exercise, and variations in skin pigmentation. These, in the main, can be circumvented through appropriate study design or measurement of absolute tissue saturation. SUMMARY: CW NIRS can assess skeletal muscle O2 delivery and utilisation without the use of expensive or invasive procedures and is useable in large population-based samples, including older adults.},

   abstract = {Skeletal muscle metabolic function is known to respond positively to exercise interventions. Developing non-invasive techniques that quantify metabolic adaptations and identifying interventions that impart successful response are ongoing challenges for research. Healthy non-athletic adults (18-35 years old) were enrolled in a study investigating physiological adaptations to a minimum of 16 weeks endurance training prior to undertaking their first marathon. Before beginning training, participants underwent measurements of skeletal muscle oxygen consumption using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) at rest (resting muscle[Formula: see text]O2) and immediately following a maximal exercise test (post-exercise muscle[Formula: see text]O2). Exercise-related increase in muscle[Formula: see text]O2 (Deltam[Formula: see text]O2) was derived from these measurements and cardio-pulmonary peak[Formula: see text]O2 measured by analysis of expired gases. All measurements were repeated within 3 weeks of participants completing following the marathon and marathon completion time recorded. Muscle[Formula: see text]O2 was positively correlated with cardio-pulmonary peak[Formula: see text]O2 (r = 0.63, p < 0.001). Muscle[Formula: see text]O2 increased at follow-up (48% increase; p = 0.004) despite no change in cardio-pulmonary peak[Formula: see text]O2 (0% change; p = 0.97). Faster marathon completion time correlated with higher cardio-pulmonary peak[Formula: see text]O2 (rpartial = -0.58, p = 0.002) but not muscle[Formula: see text]O2 (rpartial = 0.16, p = 0.44) after adjustment for age and sex [and adipose tissue thickness (ATT) for muscle[Formula: see text]O2 measurements]. Skeletal muscle metabolic adaptions occur following training and completion of a first-time marathon; these can be identified non-invasively using NIRS. Although the cardio-pulmonary system is limiting for running performance, skeletal muscle changes can be detected despite minimal improvement in cardio-pulmonary function.},

Studies investigating skeletal muscle have typically used muscle biopsy samples or magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to interrogate metabolic function. We aimed to non-invasively detect exercise-training-induced improvements in muscle function using broadband near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). We used NIRS to determine concentration changes in oxygenated haemoglobin (HbO2) and the oxidation state of cytochrome-c-oxidase (oxCCO) in gastrocnemius during arterial occlusion in 14 volunteers. We also used a cardio-pulmonary exercise test (CPET) to assess peak total body oxygen uptake (peakVO2; a measure of fitness). Measurements were made at baseline (BL) which was prior to a period of at least 16 weeks of training for the 2017 London Marathon, and then within 3 weeks after completion of the marathon, follow-up (FU). We observed an increase in locally measured muscle oxygen consumption and rate of oxCCO concentration change, but not in cardio-respiratory fitness measured as whole-body peak oxygen consumption (peakVO2).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: An exaggerated blood pressure (BP) response to exercise and low exercise capacity are risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The effect of pharmacological antihypertensive treatment on exercise BP in older adults is largely unknown. This study investigates these effects accounting for differences in exercise capacity. METHODS: Participants enrolled in the Southall and Brent Revisited (SABRE) study undertook a 6-min stepper test with expired gas analysis and BP measured throughout exercise. Participants were stratified by antihypertensive treatment status and resting BP control. Exercise systolic and diastolic BP (exSBP and exDBP) were compared between groups using potential outcome means [95% confidence intervals (CIs)] adjusted for exercise capacity. Exercise capacity was also compared by group. RESULTS: In total, 659 participants were included (mean age +/- SD: 73 +/- 6.6 years, 57% male). 31% of normotensive and 23% of hypertensive older adults with controlled resting BP had an exaggerated exercise BP. ExSBP was similar between normotensive and treated/controlled individuals [mean (95%CI): 180 (176 184) mmHg vs. 177 (173 181) mmHg, respectively] but was higher in treated/uncontrolled and untreated/uncontrolled individuals [mean (95% CI): 194 (190 197) mmHg, P < 0.001 and 199 (194 204) mmHg, P < 0.001, respectively]; these differences persisted after adjustment for exercise capacity and other confounders. Exercise capacity was lower in treated vs. normotensive individuals [mean (95% CI) normotensive: 16.7 (16.0,17.4) ml/kg/min]; treated/controlled: 15.5 (14.8,16.1) ml/kg/min, P = 0.009; treated/uncontrolled: [15.1 (14.5,15.7) ml/kg per min, P = 0.001] but was not reduced in untreated/uncontrolled individuals [mean (95% CI): 17.0 (16.1,17.8) ml/kg per min, P = 0.621]. CONCLUSION: Irrespective of resting BP control and despite performing less exercise, antihypertensive treatment does not fully mitigate an exaggerated BP response to exercise suggesting residual CVD risk in older adults.},

   abstract = {Having the physical function to undertake activities of daily living (ADLs) is essential in order to maintain independence. The aim of this study is to investigate factors associated with physical function in older adults and determine if these associations differ in men versus women. In total, 726 participants (57% men; 73+/-7 years old) from a population-based cohort, the Southall and Brent Revisited (SABRE) study, completed questionnaires permitting a physical function score (PFS) to be calculated. Detailed phenotyping was performed including cardiovascular (echocardiography and macrovascular and microvascular functions), skeletal muscle (grip strength and oxidative capacity) and lung (pulmonary) function measurements. In a sub-group, maximal aerobic capacity was estimated from a sub-maximal exercise test. In women versus men, the association between grip strength and PFS was nearly 3 times stronger, and the association between microvascular dysfunction and PFS was over 5 times stronger (standardized beta-coefficient (95% CI) 0.34 (0.22, 0.45) versus 0.11 (0.01,0.22) and -0.27 (-0.37, -0.17) versus -0.05 (-0.14, 0.04), respectively). In men, the association between cardiorespiratory fitness and PFS was 3 times greater than that in women (standardized beta-coefficient (95% CI) 0.33 (0.22, 0.45) versus 0.10 (-0.04, 0.25). Cardiovascular, skeletal muscle and pulmonary factors all contribute to self-reported physical function, but the relative pattern of contribution differs by sex. Grip strength and microvascular function are most strongly associated with physical function in women while cardiorespiratory fitness is most strongly associated with physical function in men. This is relevant to the design of effective interventions that target maintenance of physical function in old age.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Full-disclosure study describing Doppler patterns during iterative atrioventricular delay (AVD) optimization of biventricular pacemakers (cardiac resynchronization therapy, CRT). METHOD AND RESULTS: Doppler traces of the first 50 eligible patients undergoing iterative Doppler AVD optimization in the BRAVO trial were examined. Three experienced observers classified conformity to guideline-described patterns. Each observer then selected the optimum AVD on two separate occasions: blinded and unblinded to AVD. Four Doppler E-A patterns occurred: A (always merged, 18% of patients), B (incrementally less fusion at short AVDs, 12%), C (full separation at short AVDs, as described by the guidelines, 28%), and D (always separated, 42%). In Groups A and D (60%), the iterative guidelines therefore cannot specify one single AVD. On the kappa scale (0 = chance alone; 1 = perfect agreement), observer agreement for the ideal AVD in Classes B and C was poor (0.32) and appeared worse in Groups A and D (0.22). Blinding caused the scattering of the AVD selected as optimal to widen (standard deviation rising from 37 to 49 ms, P < 0.001). By blinding 28% of the selected optimum AVDs were </=60 or >/=200 ms. All 50 Doppler datasets are presented, to support future methodological testing. CONCLUSION: In most patients, the iterative method does not clearly specify one AVD. In all the patients, agreement on the ideal AVD between skilled observers viewing identical images is poor. The iterative protocol may successfully exclude some extremely unsuitable AVDs, but so might simply accepting factory default. Irreproducibility of the gold standard also prevents alternative physiological optimization methods from being validated honestly.},

   abstract = {It is often necessary to assess physical function in older adults to monitor disease progression, rehabilitation or decline in function with age. However, increasing frailty and poor balance that accompany aging are common barriers to exercise testing protocols. We investigated whether a 6-min stepper test (6MST) was acceptable to older adults and provided a measure of exercise capacity and a predicted value for peak aerobic capacity (VO(2max)). 635 older adults from a tri-ethnic UK population-based cohort were screened to undertake a self-paced 6MST. Expired gas analysis, heart rate and blood pressure monitoring were carried out. A sub-set of 20 participants performed a second 6MST for assessment of reproducibility and a further sub-set of 10 performed the 6-min walk test as verification against a well-recognized and accepted self-paced exercise test. 518 (82%) participants met inclusion criteria and undertook the 6MST (299 men, mean age 71.2 +/- 6.4). Step rate showed a strong positive correlation with measured VO(2) (r = 0.75, p < 0.001) and VO(2) was lower in women (male-female difference in VO(2) = 2.61 (95% confidence interval -3.6, -1.7) ml/min/kg; p < 0.001). 20 participants repeated a 6MST, step rate was higher in the second test but the predicted VO(2max) showed good agreement (mean difference = 0.1 [3.72, 3.95] ml/min/kg). In 10 participants who completed a 6MST and a 6-min walk test there was a strong positive correlation between walking rate and step rate (r = 0.77; p < 0.009) and weaker positive correlations between the tests for measured VO(2) and peak heart rate. In conclusion, the 6MST is a convenient, acceptable method of assessing exercise capacity in older adults that allows VO(2max) to be predicted reproducibly. The test shows good correlation between performance and measured physiological markers of performance and can detect the expected gender differences in measured VO(2). Furthermore, the 6MST results correlate with a previously verified and established self-paced exercise test.},

   abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to compare exercise capacity, strength and skeletal muscle perfusion during exercise, and oxidative capacity between South Asians, African Caribbeans and Europeans, and determine what effect ethnic differences in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has on these functional outcomes. METHODS: In total, 708 participants (aged [mean+/-SD] 73 +/- 7 years, 56% male) were recruited from the Southall and Brent Revisited (SABRE) study, a UK population-based cohort comprised of Europeans (n = 311) and South Asian (n = 232) and African Caribbean (n = 165) migrants. Measurements of exercise capacity using a 6 min stepper test (6MST), including measurement of oxygen consumption ([Formula: see text]) and grip strength, were performed. Skeletal muscle was assessed using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS); measures included changes in tissue saturation index (TSI%) with exercise and oxidative capacity (muscle oxygen consumption recovery, represented by a time constant [tau]). Analysis was by multiple linear regression. RESULTS: When adjusted for age and sex, in South Asians and African Caribbeans, exercise capacity was reduced compared with Europeans ([Formula: see text] [ml min(-1) kg(-1)]: beta = -1.2 [95% CI -1.9, -0.4], p = 0.002, and beta -1.7 [95% CI -2.5, -0.8], p < 0.001, respectively). South Asians had lower and African Caribbeans had higher strength compared with Europeans (strength [kPa]: beta = -9 [95% CI -12, -6), p < 0.001, and beta = 6 [95% CI 3, 9], p < 0.001, respectively). South Asians had greater decreases in TSI% and longer tau compared with Europeans (TSI% [%]: beta = -0.9 [95% CI -1.7, -0.1), p = 0.024; tau [s]: beta = 11 [95% CI 3, 18], p = 0.006). Ethnic differences in [Formula: see text] and grip strength remained despite adjustment for type 2 diabetes or HbA1c (and fat-free mass for grip strength). However, the differences between Europeans and South Asians were no longer statistically significant after adjustment for other possible mediators or confounders (including physical activity, waist-to-hip ratio, cardiovascular disease or hypertension, smoking, haemoglobin levels or beta-blocker use). The difference in TSI% between Europeans and South Asians was marginally attenuated after adjustment for type 2 diabetes or HbA1c and was also no longer statistically significant after adjusting for other confounders; however, tau remained significantly longer in South Asians vs Europeans despite adjustment for all confounders. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Reduced exercise capacity in South Asians and African Caribbeans is unexplained by higher rates of type 2 diabetes. Poorer exercise tolerance in these populations, and impaired muscle function and perfusion in South Asians, may contribute to the higher morbidity burden of UK ethnic minority groups in older age.},

   abstract = {Measuring local haemodynamics in skeletal muscle has the potential to provide valuable insight into the oxygen delivery to tissue, especially during high demand situations such as exercise. The aim of this study was to compare the skeletal muscle microvascular response during post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia (PORH) with the response to exercise, each measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and to establish if associations exist between muscle measures and exercise capacity or sex. Participants were from a population-based cohort study, the Southall and Brent Revisited (SABRE) study. Skeletal muscle measures included changes in tissue saturation index at the onset of exercise (∆TSI(BL-INC)) and across the whole of exercise (∆TSI(BL-EE)), time to 50%, 95% and 100% PORH, rate of PORH recovery, area under the curve (AUC) and total oxygenated Haemoglobin (oxy-Hb) change during PORH. Exercise capacity was measured using a 6-min stepper test (6MST). Analysis was by multiple linear regression. In total, 558 participants completed the 6MST with NIRS measures of TSI (mean age+/-SD: 73 +/- 7years, 59% male). A sub-set of 149 participants also undertook the arterial occlusion. Time to 100% PORH, recovery rate, AUC and ∆oxy-Hb were all associated with ∆TSI(BL-EE) (beta-coefficient (95%CI): 0.05 (0.01, 0.09), p = 0.012; -47 (-85, -9.9), p = 0.014; 1.7 (0.62, 2.8), p = 0.002; 0.04 (0.002.0.108), p = 0.041, respectively). Time to 95% & 100% PORH, AUC and ∆oxy-Hb were all associated with ∆TSI(BL-INC) (beta-coefficient (95%CI): -0.07 (-0.12,-0.02), p = 0.02; -0.03 (-0.05, -0.003), p = 0.028; 0.85 (0.18, 1.5), p = 0.013 & 0.05 (0.02, 0.09), p = 0.001, respectively). AUC and ∆Oxy-Hb were associated with steps achieved (beta-coefficient (95%CI): 18.0 (2.3, 33.7), p = 0.025; 0.86 (0.10, 1.6), p = 0.027). ∆TSI(BL-EE) was associated with steps and highest VO(2) (1.7 (0.49, 2.9), p = 0.006; 7.7 (3.2, 12.3), p = 0.001). ∆TSI(BL-INC) was associated with steps and VO(2) but this difference was attenuated towards the null after adjustment for age, sex and ethnicity. ∆TSI(BL-EE) was greater in women (3.4 (0.4, 8.9) versus 2.1 (0.3, 7.4), p = 0.017) and ∆TSI(BL-INC) was lower in women versus men (2.4 (0.2, 10.2) versus 3.2 (0.2, 18.2), p = 0.016). These Local microvascular NIRS-measures are associated with exercise capacity in older adults and several measures can detect differences in microvascular reactivity between a community-based sample of men and women.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy allows triglycerides to be subclassified into 14 different classes based on particle size and lipid content. We recently showed that these subfractions have differential associations with cardiovascular disease events. Here we report the distributions and define reference interval ranges for 14 triglyceride-containing lipoprotein subfraction metabolites. METHODS: Lipoprotein subfractions using the Nightingale NMR platform were measured in 9073 participants from four cohort studies contributing to the UCL-Edinburgh-Bristol consortium. The distribution of each metabolite was assessed, and reference interval ranges were calculated for a disease-free population, by sex and age group (<55, 55-65, >65 years), and in a subgroup population of participants with cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes. We also determined the distribution across body mass index and smoking status. RESULTS: The largest reference interval range was observed in the medium very-low density lipoprotein subclass (2.5th 97.5th percentile; 0.08 to 0.68 mmol/L). The reference intervals were comparable among male and female participants, with the exception of triglyceride in high-density lipoprotein. Triglyceride subfraction concentrations in very-low density lipoprotein, intermediate-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein subclasses increased with increasing age and increasing body mass index. Triglyceride subfraction concentrations were significantly higher in ever smokers compared to never smokers, among those with clinical chemistry measured total triglyceride greater than 1.7 mmol/L, and in those with cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes as compared to disease-free subjects. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to establish reference interval ranges for 14 triglyceride-containing lipoprotein subfractions in samples from the general population measured using the nuclear magnetic resonance platform. The utility of nuclear magnetic resonance lipid measures may lead to greater insights for the role of triglyceride in cardiovascular disease, emphasizing the importance of appropriate reference interval ranges for future clinical decision making.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease; however, there is uncertainty about the role of total triglycerides and the individual triglyceride-containing lipoprotein sub-fractions. We measured 14 triglyceride-containing lipoprotein sub-fractions using nuclear magnetic resonance and examined associations with coronary heart disease and stroke. METHODS: Triglyceride-containing sub-fraction measures were available in 11,560 participants from the three UK cohorts free of coronary heart disease and stroke at baseline. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the association of each sub-fraction with coronary heart disease and stroke expressed as the odds ratio per standard deviation increment in the corresponding measure. RESULTS: The 14 triglyceride-containing sub-fractions were positively correlated with one another and with total triglycerides, and inversely correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Thirteen sub-fractions were positively associated with coronary heart disease (odds ratio in the range 1.12 to 1.22), with the effect estimates for coronary heart disease being comparable in subgroup analysis of participants with and without type 2 diabetes, and were attenuated after adjustment for HDL-C and LDL-C. There was no evidence for a clear association of any triglyceride lipoprotein sub-fraction with stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Triglyceride sub-fractions are associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease but not stroke, with attenuation of effects on adjustment for HDL-C and LDL-C.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ventricular arrhythmia in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) relates to adverse structural change and genetic status. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)-guided electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) noninvasively maps cardiac structural and electrophysiological (EP) properties. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to establish whether in subclinical HCM (genotype [G]+ left ventricular hypertrophy [LVH]-), ECGI detects early EP abnormality, and in overt HCM, whether the EP substrate relates to genetic status (G+/G-LVH+) and structural phenotype. METHODS: This was a prospective 211-participant CMR-ECGI multicenter study of 70 G+LVH-, 104 LVH+ (51 G+/53 G-), and 37 healthy volunteers (HVs). Local activation time (AT), corrected repolarization time, corrected activation-recovery interval, spatial gradients (G(AT)/G(RTc)), and signal fractionation were derived from 1,000 epicardial sites per participant. Maximal wall thickness and scar burden were derived from CMR. A support vector machine was built to discriminate G+LVH- from HV and low-risk HCM from those with intermediate/high-risk score or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. RESULTS: Compared with HV, subclinical HCM showed mean AT prolongation (P = 0.008) even with normal 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) (P = 0.009), and repolarization was more spatially heterogenous (G(RTc): P = 0.005) (23% had normal ECGs). Corrected activation-recovery interval was prolonged in overt vs subclinical HCM (P < 0.001). Mean AT was associated with maximal wall thickness; spatial conduction heterogeneity (G(AT)) and fractionation were associated with scar (all P < 0.05), and G+LVH+ had more fractionation than G-LVH+ (P = 0.002). The support vector machine discriminated subclinical HCM from HV (10-fold cross-validation accuracy 80% [95% CI: 73%-85%]) and identified patients at higher risk of sudden cardiac death (accuracy 82% [95% CI: 78%-86%]). CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of LVH or 12-lead ECG abnormalities, HCM sarcomere gene mutation carriers express an aberrant EP phenotype detected by ECGI. In overt HCM, abnormalities occur more severely with adverse structural change and positive genetic status.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Diabetes has adverse effects on the retinal microvasculature. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of inhalation of hypoxic, hyperoxic and normoxic-hypercapnic gas mixtures on retinal vessel diameter in people with and without diabetes. METHODS: Sixty-one participants (aged 24-50 years) 29 with (male : female ratio 2.6 : 1) and 32 without (male : female ratio 0.7 : 1) diabetes, inhaled hypoxic, hyperoxic and normoxic-hypercapnic gas mixtures for 3-5 mins. The diameters of arterioles and venules were measured using digital retinal images taken before and after gas inhalation. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the diameters of arterioles and venules prior to gas inhalation in people with and without diabetes. Inhalation of the hyperoxic gas mixture caused a statistically significant decrease in arteriolar and venular diameters without altering mean arterial pressure significantly. Arteriolar vasoconstriction in response to the hyperoxic gas mixture was significantly reduced in people with diabetes (3.95% versus 7.75%; p = 0.04), but venular vasoconstriction did not differ significantly. A hypoxic gas mixture caused increased arteriolar and venular diameter and a normoxic-hypercapnic gas mixture had no significant effect on vessel diameter. Responses to hypoxic and normoxic-hypercapnic gas did not differ significantly between diabetes and non-diabetes subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Type 1 diabetes impairs retinal arteriolar responses to hyperoxia. Abnormalities in retinal arteriolar reactivity in response to oxygen may play a role in the development of diabetic retinopathy and this technique may represent a simple means of identifying early abnormalities in the reactivity of retinal arterioles in diabetes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: High blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. Epigenetic processes including DNA methylation potentially mediate the relationship between genetic factors, the environment and cardiovascular disease. Despite an increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease in individuals of South Asians compared to Europeans, it is not clear whether associations between blood pressure and DNA methylation differ between these groups. METHODS: We performed an epigenome-wide association study and differentially methylated region (DMR) analysis to identify DNA methylation sites and regions that were associated with systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and hypertension. We analyzed samples from 364 European and 348 South Asian men (first generation migrants to the UK) from the Southall And Brent REvisited cohort, measuring DNA methylation from blood using the Illumina Infinium(R) HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. RESULTS: One CpG site was found to be associated with DBP in trans-ancestry analyses (i.e. both ethnic groups combined), while in Europeans alone seven CpG sites were associated with DBP. No associations were identified between DNA methylation and either SBP or hypertension. Comparison of effect sizes between South Asian and European EWAS for DBP, SBP and hypertension revealed little concordance between analyses. DMR analysis identified several regions with known relationships with CVD and its risk factors. CONCLUSION: This study identified differentially methylated sites and regions associated with blood pressure and revealed ethnic differences in these associations. These findings may point to molecular pathways which may explain the elevated cardiovascular disease risk experienced by those of South Asian ancestry when compared to Europeans.},

   abstract = {The continuing expansion of seaweed cultivation could assist in ensuring future global food security. The Laminariales species Alaria esculenta and Saccharina latissima are each cultivated for food across their European ranges. The predominant method for cultivating European kelps involves growing juveniles on twine within a hatchery which is then deployed at a farm site. The associated hatchery and deployment cost of this approach are relatively high. A new and innovative methodology-called binder-seeding-can reduce these costs, but, has yet to be validated. We compare the biomass yield and morphology of A. esculenta and S. latissima cultured using either the traditional twine-longline method or binder-seeding onto AlgaeRope and AlgaeRibbon, specially designed textiles. In a controlled growth experiment, A. esculenta had a similar biomass yield on all materials, but fronds were shorter (23 +/- 7%) and thinner on the AlgaeRibbon (42 +/- 4%) due to a 3-4-fold higher density of developing sporophytes compared to the twine-longline. In contrast, S. latissima gave a 4-fold higher biomass yield on the AlgaeRibbon in June (4.0 kg m(-1)), but frond morphology was not different between materials, despite a 4-fold higher sporophyte density on the AlgaeRibbon. The stipe length of both species also increased at the higher sporophyte density on the AlgaeRibbon. The AlgaeRope gave an intermediate response or was similar to the twine-longline. These results show that binder-seeding onto the AlgaeRibbon significantly increases the achieved biomass yield in S. latissima. These results can assist cultivators to select the most appropriate method of kelp cultivation depending on morphological/yield requirements of the end use. Further study is needed on the optimisation of the binder-seeding density and its impact on thallus morphology.},

   abstract = {Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibition reduces vascular event risk, but confusion surrounds its effects on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Here, we clarify associations of genetic inhibition of CETP on detailed lipoprotein measures and compare those to genetic inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR). We used an allele associated with lower CETP expression (rs247617) to mimic CETP inhibition and an allele associated with lower HMGCR expression (rs12916) to mimic the well-known effects of statins for comparison. The study consists of 65,427 participants of European ancestries with detailed lipoprotein subclass profiling from nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Genetic associations were scaled to 10% reduction in relative risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). We also examined observational associations of the lipoprotein subclass measures with risk of incident CHD in 3 population-based cohorts totalling 616 incident cases and 13,564 controls during 8-year follow-up. Genetic inhibition of CETP and HMGCR resulted in near-identical associations with LDL cholesterol concentration estimated by the Friedewald equation. Inhibition of HMGCR had relatively consistent associations on lower cholesterol concentrations across all apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. In contrast, the associations of the inhibition of CETP were stronger on lower remnant and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, but there were no associations on cholesterol concentrations in LDL defined by particle size (diameter 18-26 nm) (-0.02 SD LDL defined by particle size; 95% CI: -0.10 to 0.05 for CETP versus -0.24 SD, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.18 for HMGCR). Inhibition of CETP was strongly associated with lower proportion of triglycerides in all high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. In observational analyses, a higher triglyceride composition within HDL subclasses was associated with higher risk of CHD, independently of total cholesterol and triglycerides (strongest hazard ratio per 1 SD higher triglyceride composition in very large HDL 1.35; 95% CI: 1.18-1.54). In conclusion, CETP inhibition does not appear to affect size-specific LDL cholesterol but is likely to lower CHD risk by lowering concentrations of other atherogenic, apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (such as remnant and VLDLs). Inhibition of CETP also lowers triglyceride composition in HDL particles, a phenomenon reflecting combined effects of circulating HDL, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B-containing particles and is associated with a lower CHD risk in observational analyses. Our results reveal that conventional composite lipid assays may mask heterogeneous effects of emerging lipid-altering therapies.},

   abstract = {AIMS: We aimed to determine whether the levels of total serum IgM and IgG, together with specific antibodies against malondialdehyde-conjugated low-density lipoprotein (MDA-LDL), can improve cardiovascular risk discrimination. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) randomized 9098 patients in the UK and Ireland into the Blood Pressure-Lowering Arm. 485 patients that had cardiovascular (CV) events over 5.5years were age and sex matched with 1367 controls. Higher baseline total serum IgG, and to a lesser extent IgM, were associated with decreased risk of CV events (IgG odds ratio (OR) per one standard deviation (SD) 0.80 [95% confidence interval, CI 0.72,0.89], p<0.0001; IgM 0.83[0.75,0.93], p=0.001), and particularly events due to coronary heart disease (CHD) (IgG OR 0.66 (0.57,0.76); p<0.0001, IgM OR 0.81 (0.71,0.93); p=0.002). The association persisted after adjustment for a basic model with variables in the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) as well as following inclusion of C-reactive protein (CRP) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NtProBNP). IgG and IgM antibodies against MDA-LDL were also associated with CV events but their significance was lost following adjustment for total serum IgG and IgM respectively. The area under the receiver operator curve for CV events was improved from the basic risk model when adding in total serum IgG, and there was improvement in continuous and categorical net reclassification (17.6% and 7.5% respectively) as well as in the integrated discrimination index. CONCLUSION: High total serum IgG levels are an independent predictor of freedom from adverse cardiovascular events, particularly those attributed to CHD, in patients with hypertension.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We aimed to estimate multimorbidity trajectories and quantify socioeconomic inequalities based on childhood and adulthood socioeconomic position (SEP) in the risks and rates of multimorbidity accumulation across adulthood. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Participants from the UK 1946 National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) birth cohort study who attended the age 36 years assessment in 1982 and any one of the follow-up assessments at ages 43, 53, 63, and 69 years (N = 3,723, 51% males). Information on 18 health conditions was based on a combination of self-report, biomarkers, health records, and prescribed medications. We estimated multimorbidity trajectories and delineated socioeconomic inequalities (based on childhood and adulthood social class and highest education) in multimorbidity at each age and in longitudinal trajectories. Multimorbidity increased with age (0.7 conditions at 36 years to 3.7 at 69 years). Multimorbidity accumulation was nonlinear, accelerating with age at the rate of 0.08 conditions/year (95% CI 0.07 to 0.09, p < 0.001) at 36 to 43 years to 0.19 conditions/year (95% CI 0.18 to 0.20, p < 0.001) at 63 to 69 years. At all ages, the most socioeconomically disadvantaged had 1.2 to 1.4 times greater number of conditions on average compared to the most advantaged. The most disadvantaged by each socioeconomic indicator experienced an additional 0.39 conditions (childhood social class), 0.83 (adult social class), and 1.08 conditions (adult education) at age 69 years, independent of all other socioeconomic indicators. Adverse adulthood SEP was associated with more rapid accumulation of multimorbidity, resulting in 0.49 excess conditions in partly/unskilled compared to professional/intermediate individuals between 63 and 69 years. Disadvantaged childhood social class, independently of adulthood SEP, was associated with accelerated multimorbidity trajectories from age 53 years onwards. Study limitations include that the NSHD cohort is composed of individuals of white European heritage only, and findings may not be generalizable to the non-white British population of the same generation and did not account for other important dimensions of SEP such as income and wealth. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals have earlier onset and more rapid accumulation of multimorbidity resulting in widening inequalities into old age, with independent contributions from both childhood and adulthood SEP.},

   abstract = {The carotid bifurcation has been a region of particular interest due to its predilection for clinically significant atherosclerosis. It has been shown that the vessel geometry is a major determinant of the local haemodynamic properties which are believed to be associated with the location of atherosclerotic lesions. Current knowledge of the geometry of the carotid bifurcation is insufficient and restricted to basic geometric parameters. To provide some means of quantifying the degree of complexity of the 3D shape of the bifurcation, we made an initial attempt by evaluating the non-planarity of an arterial bifurcation based upon the singular value decomposition theorem. In this paper we present our results obtained on the right carotid bifurcations of six normal subjects, each of whom was scanned twice using the 2D time-of-flight MR sequence. The acquired 2D cross sectional images were processed by using our in-house software which comprises 2D segmentation, 3D reconstruction and smoothing. The centroids of each transverse slices were determined and used as input data for the non-planarity analysis. Our results using the singular value decomposition method have demonstrated discernible differences in non-planarity among individuals. Comparisons with the planarity definition proposed by other investigators suggest that the singular value decomposition method offers more information about the linearity and planarity of the bifurcation. However, it is also realised that a single measure of non-planarity can never fully characterise a bifurcation owing to the great variety of geometries.},

   abstract = {A realistic mock circulatory system (MCS) could be a valuable in vitro testbed to study human circulatory hemodynamics. The objective of this study was to design a MCS replicating the pulmonary arterial circulation, incorporating an anatomically representative arterial model suitable for testing clinically relevant scenarios. A second objective of the study was to ensure the system's compatibility with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for additional measurements. A latex pulmonary arterial model with two generations of bifurcations was manufactured starting from a 3D-printed mold reconstructed from patient data. The model was incorporated into a MCS for in vitro hydrodynamic measurements. The setup was tested under physiological pulsatile flow conditions and results were evaluated using wave intensity analysis (WIA) to investigate waves traveling in the arterial system. Increased pulmonary vascular resistance (IPVR) was simulated as an example of one pathological scenario. Flow split between right and left pulmonary artery was found to be realistic (54 and 46%, respectively). No substantial difference in pressure waveform was observed throughout the various generations of bifurcations. Based on WIA, three main waves were identified in the main pulmonary artery (MPA), that is, forward compression wave, backward compression wave, and forward expansion wave. For IPVR, a rise in mean pressure was recorded in the MPA, within the clinical range of pulmonary arterial hypertension. The feasibility of using the MCS in the MRI scanner was demonstrated with the MCS running 2 h consecutively while acquiring preliminary MRI data. This study shows the development and verification of a pulmonary MCS, including an anatomically correct, compliant latex phantom. The setup can be useful to explore a wide range of hemodynamic questions, including the development of patient- and pathology-specific models, considering the ease and low cost of producing rapid prototyping molds, and the versatility of the setup for invasive and noninvasive (i.e., MRI) measurements.},

   abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is increasingly being developed for the diagnostics of arterial diseases. Imaging methods such as computed tomography (CT) and angiography are commonly used. However, these have limited spatial resolution and are subject to movement artifact. This study developed a new approach to generate CFD models by combining high-fidelity, patient-specific coronary anatomy models derived from optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging with patient-specific pressure and velocity phasic data. Additionally, we used a new technique which does not require the catheter to be used to determine the centerline of the vessel. The CFD data were then compared with invasively measured pressure and velocity. Angiography imaging data of 21 vessels collected from 19 patients were fused with OCT visualizations of the same vessels using an algorithm that produces reconstructions inheriting the in-plane (10 mum) and longitudinal (0.2 mm) resolution of OCT. Proximal pressure and distal velocity waveforms ensemble averaged from invasively measured data were used as inlet and outlet boundary conditions, respectively, in CFD simulations. The resulting distal pressure waveform was compared against the measured waveform to test the model. The results followed the shape of the measured waveforms closely (cross-correlation coefficient = 0.898 +/- 0.005, ), indicating realistic modeling of flow resistance, the mean of differences between measured and simulated results was -3. 5 mmHg, standard deviation of differences (SDD) = 8.2 mmHg over the cycle and -9.8 mmHg, SDD = 16.4 mmHg at peak flow. Models incorporating phasic velocity in patient-specific models of coronary anatomy derived from high-resolution OCT images show a good correlation with the measured pressure waveforms in all cases, indicating that the model results may be an accurate representation of the measured flow conditions.},

We investigated the effect of selective inhibitors of Src family tyrosine kinases (SFK) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced vascular hyporeactivity. Rat tail artery segments were mounted in an isometric wire myograph. The effect of incubation with LPS was examined on phenylephrine (PE) and high potassium (KPSS)-induced contraction, with and without the selective SFK inhibitors SU6656 or PP1. Western blotting was performed to assess SFK phosphorylation and iNOS induction. Incubation with LPS for 18 h induced marked vascular hyporeactivity to both PE (p<0.001) and KPSS (P<0.001). Incubation with SU6656 alone had no effect on contractility to PE and KPSS, and SU6656 partially prevented LPS-induced hyporeactivity to PE (p<0.01) and KPSS (p<0.001). In contrast, PP1 alone diminished contractility to PE (p<0.01) and KPSS (p<0.001), and co-incubation of LPS with PP1 completely prevented LPS-induced hyporeactivity. LPS increased tyrosine phosphorylation of SFK and this effect was inhibited by SFK inhibitors. LPS also increased levels of iNOS and this was also inhibited by SU6656 and PP1. LPS-induced hyporeactivity in vitro is mediated by activation of SFK. Selective inhibitors of SFK may have therapeutic potential in the management of septic shock.},

This study examined the effect of inorganic nitrate in beetroot juice on aortic (central) BP acutely and over the subsequent 24-h period. A double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial was performed in fifteen healthy, normotensive men and women (age 22-40 years). Participants were randomized to receive beetroot juice containing nitrate (6.5-7.3 mmol) or placebo beetroot juice from which nitrate had been removed (<0.06 mmol nitrate). Effects on aortic systolic BP were measured at 30 min (primary endpoint), 60 min and over a subsequent 24 h period using an ambulatory BP monitor. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) was also measured at 30 min. Following a washout period, the procedure was repeated within 7 days with crossover to the opposite arm of the trial. Compared with placebo, ingestion of beetroot juice containing nitrate lowered aortic systolic BP at 30 min by 5.2 (1.9-8.5) mmHg [mean (95% confidence interval); p < 0.01]. A smaller effect on aortic systolic BP was observed at 60 min. There were minimal effects on brachial BP or cfPWV. Effects on aortic systolic BP were not sustained over the subsequent 24 h and there were no effects on other hemodynamic parameters during ambulatory monitoring. A single dose of beetroot juice containing nitrate lowers aortic BP more effectively than brachial BP in the short term, but the effects are comparatively short-lived and do not persist over the course of the same day.},

The effects were compared with sildenafil, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Patch clamp was used to record whole cell current in rat isolated corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Isometric tension was measured in intracavernous arterial rings and corpus cavernosum strips isolated from rats and men, and simultaneous measurements of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and tension were performed in intracavernous arteries. Erectile response was measured in anaesthetized rats. KEY RESULTS: In patch clamp recordings, NS11021 increased currents sensitive to the selective BK(Ca) channel blocker, iberiotoxin (IbTX) in SMCs, but did not modulate K(+) current in HUVECs. NS11021 reduced [Ca(2+)](i) and tension in penile arteries. IbTX inhibited the vasorelaxation induced by NS11021 and sildenafil in human erectile tissue. NS11021 and sildenafil but not vehicle increased erectile responses in anaesthetized rats, an effect which was abolished after pretreatment with tetraethylammonium. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: NS11021 leads to relaxation of both intracavernous arteries and corpus cavernosum strips primarily through opening of BK(Ca) channels. It is also effective in facilitating erectile responses in anaesthetized rats. These results suggest a potential for use of BK(Ca) openers in the treatment of ED.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In atrial fibrillation (AF), VV optimization of biventricular pacemakers can be examined in isolation. We used this approach to evaluate internal validity of three VV optimization methods by three criteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty patients (16 men, age 75 +/- 7) in AF were optimized, at two paced heart rates, by LVOT VTI (flow), non-invasive arterial pressure, and ECG (minimizing QRS duration). Each optimization method was evaluated for: singularity (unique peak of function), reproducibility of optimum, and biological plausibility of the distribution of optima. The reproducibility (standard deviation of the difference, SDD) of the optimal VV delay was 10 ms for pressure, versus 8 ms (p=ns) for QRS and 34 ms (p<0.01) for flow. Singularity of optimum was 85% for pressure, 63% for ECG and 45% for flow (Chi(2)=10.9, p<0.005). The distribution of pressure optima was biologically plausible, with 80% LV pre-excited (p=0.007). The distributions of ECG (55% LV pre-excitation) and flow (45% LV pre-excitation) optima were no different to random (p=ns). The pressure-derived optimal VV delay is unaffected by the paced rate: SDD between slow and fast heart rate is 9 ms, no different from the reproducibility SDD at both heart rates. CONCLUSIONS: Using non-invasive arterial pressure, VV delay optimization by parabolic fitting is achievable with good precision, satisfying all 3 criteria of internal validity. VV optimum is unaffected by heart rate. Neither QRS minimization nor LVOT VTI satisfy all validity criteria, and therefore seem weaker candidate modalities for VV optimization. AF, unlinking interventricular from atrioventricular delay, uniquely exposes resynchronization concepts to experimental scrutiny.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mechanoenergetic effects of atrioventricular delay optimization during biventricular pacing ("cardiac resynchronization therapy", CRT) are unknown. METHODS: Eleven patients with heart failure and left bundle branch block (LBBB) underwent invasive measurements of left ventricular (LV) developed pressure, aortic flow velocity-time-integral (VTI) and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) at 4 pacing states: biventricular pacing (with VV 0 ms) at AVD 40 ms (AV-40), AVD 120 ms (AV-120, a common nominal AV delay), at their pre-identified individualised haemodynamic optimum (AV-Opt); and intrinsic conduction (LBBB). RESULTS: AV-120, relative to LBBB, increased LV developed pressure by a mean of 11(SEM 2)%, p=0.001, and aortic VTI by 11(SEM 3)%, p=0.002, but also increased MVO2 by 11(SEM 5)%, p=0.04. AV-Opt further increased LV developed pressure by a mean of 2(SEM 1)%, p=0.035 and aortic VTI by 4(SEM 1)%, p=0.017. MVO2 trended further up by 7(SEM 5)%, p=0.22. Mechanoenergetics at AV-40 were no different from LBBB. The 4 states lay on a straight line for Deltaexternal work (DeltaLV developed pressure x Deltaaortic VTI) against DeltaMVO2, with slope 1.80, significantly >1 (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Biventricular pacing and atrioventricular delay optimization increased external cardiac work done but also myocardial oxygen consumption. Nevertheless, the increase in cardiac work was ~80% greater than the increase in oxygen consumption, signifying an improvement in cardiac mechanoenergetics. Finally, the incremental effect of optimization on external work was approximately one-third beyond that of nominal AV pacing, along the same favourable efficiency trajectory, suggesting that AV delay dominates the biventricular pacing effect - which may therefore not be mainly "resynchronization".},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hemodynamic optimization of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) can be achieved reproducibly and--with bulky, nonimplantable equipment--noninvasively. We explored whether a simple photoplethysmogram signal might be used instead. METHOD: Twenty patients (age 65 +/- 12) with CRT underwent automatic atrioventricular (AV) delay optimization, using a multiple-transitions protocol, at two atrially paced heart rates: just above sinus rate ("slow ApVp," 77 +/- 11 beats per minute [bpm]) and 100 bpm ("fast ApVp"). We then retested to assess short-term reproducibility. RESULTS: All 80 optimizations identified an optimum (correctly oriented parabola). At 100 bpm, the simple photoplethysmogram had wider scatter between repeat optimizations than did Finometer: standard deviation of difference (SDD) 22 ms versus 14 ms, respectively, P = 0.028. The simple photoplethysmogram improved in reproducibility when slope (instead of peak) of its signal was used for optimization, becoming as reproducible as Finometer (SDD 14 ms vs 14 ms, P = 0.50). At slow heart rate, reproducibility of simple photoplethysmogram-based optimization worsened from 14 to 22 ms (P = 0.028), and Finometer-based optimization from 14 to 26 ms (P = 0.005). Increasing the number of replicates averaged improved reproducibility. For example, SDD of simple photoplethysmogram optimization (using peak) fell from 62 ms with two replicates to 22 ms with eight replicates (P < 0.0001). At 100 bpm, the eight-replicate protocol takes approximately 12 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: A 12-minute protocol of simple photoplethysmographic AV optimization can be processed fully automatically. Blinded test-retest reproducibility of the optimum AV is good and improves with more replicates. If benefits to some patients are not to be neutralized by harm to others, endpoint studies should first test check narrowness of "within-patient error bars."},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Controversy exists regarding how atrial activation mode and heart rate affect optimal atrioventricular (AV) delay in cardiac resynchronization therapy. We studied these questions using high-reproducibility hemodynamic and echocardiographic measurements. METHODS: Twenty patients were hemodynamically optimized using noninvasive beat-to-beat blood pressure at rest (62 +/- 11 beats/min), during exercise (80 +/- 6 beats/min), and at three atrially paced rates: 5, 25, and 45 beats/min above rest, denoted as Apaced,r+5 , Apaced,r+25 , and Apaced,r+45 , respectively. Left atrial myocardial motion and transmitral flow were timed echocardiographically. RESULTS: During atrial sensing, raising heart rate shortened optimal AV delay by 25 +/- 6 ms (P < 0.001). During atrial pacing, raising heart rate from Apaced,r+5 to Apaced,r+25 shortened it by 16 +/- 6 ms; Apaced,r+45 shortened it 17 +/- 6 ms further (P < 0.001). In comparison to atrial-sensed activation, atrial pacing lengthened optimal AV delay by 76 +/- 6 ms (P < 0.0001) at rest, and at approximately 20 beats/min faster, by 85 +/- 7 ms (P < 0.0001), 9 +/- 4 ms more (P = 0.017). Mechanically, atrial pacing delayed left atrial contraction by 63 +/- 5 ms at rest and by 73 +/- 5 ms (i.e., by 10 +/- 5 ms more, P < 0.05) at approximately 20 beats/min faster. Raising atrial rate by exercise advanced left atrial contraction by 7 +/- 2 ms (P = 0.001). Raising it by atrial pacing did not (P = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: Hemodynamic optimal AV delay shortens with elevation of heart rate. It lengthens on switching from atrial-sensed to atrial-paced at the same rate, and echocardiography shows this sensed-paced difference in optima results from a sensed-paced difference in atrial electromechanical delay. The reason for the widening of the sensed-paced difference in AV optimum may be physiological stimuli (e.g., adrenergic drive) advancing left atrial contraction during exercise but not with fast atrial pacing.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Normal coronary blood flow is principally determined by a backward-traveling decompression (suction) wave in diastole. Dyssynchronous chronic heart failure may attenuate suction, because regional relaxation and contraction overlap in timing. We hypothesized that biventricular pacing, by restoring left ventricular (LV) synchronization and improving LV relaxation, might increase this suction wave, improving coronary flow. METHOD AND RESULTS: Ten patients with chronic heart failure (9 males; age 65+/-12; ejection fraction 26+/-7%) with left bundle-branch block (LBBB; QRS duration 174+/-18 ms) were atriobiventricularly paced at 100 bpm. LV pressure was measured and wave intensity calculated from invasive coronary flow velocity and pressure, with native conduction (LBBB) and during biventricular pacing at atrioventricular (AV) delays of 40 ms, 120 ms, and separately preidentified hemodynamically optimal AV delay. In comparison with LBBB, biventricular pacing at separately preidentified hemodynamically optimal AV delay (BiV-Opt) enhanced coronary flow velocity time integral by 15% (7%-25%) (P=0.007), LV dP/dt(max) by 15% (10%-21%) (P=0.005), and (neg)dP/dt(max) by 17% (9%-22%) (P=0.005). The cumulative intensity of the diastolic backward decompression (suction) wave increased by 26% (18%-54%) (P=0.005). The majority of the increase in coronary flow velocity time integral occurred in diastole (69% [41%-84% ]; P=0.047). The systolic compression waves also increased: forward by 36% (6%-49%) (P=0.022) and backward by 38% (20%-55%) (P=0.022). Biventricular pacing at AV delays of 120 ms generated a smaller LV dP/dt(max) (by 12% [5%-23% ], P=0.013) and (neg)dP/dt(max) (by 15% [8%-40% ]; P=0.009) increase than BiV-Opt, against LBBB as reference; BiV-Opt and biventricular pacing at AV delays of 120 ms were not significantly different in coronary flow velocity time integral or waves. Biventricular pacing at AV delays of 40 ms was no different from LBBB. CONCLUSIONS: When biventricular pacing improves LV contraction and relaxation, it increases coronary blood flow velocity, predominantly by increasing the dominant diastolic backward decompression (suction) wave.},

   abstract = {Health economics evidence informs health-care decision making, but the field has historically paid insufficient attention to mental health. Economic evaluations in health should define an appropriate scope for benefits and costs and how to value them. This Health Policy provides an overview of these processes and considers to what extent they capture the value of mental health. We suggest that although current practices are both transparent and justifiable, they have distinct limitations from the perspective of mental health. Most social value judgements, such as the exclusion of interindividual outcomes and intersectoral costs, diminish the value of improving mental health, and this reduction in value might be disproportionate compared with other types of health. Economic analyses might have disadvantaged interventions that improve mental health compared with physical health, but research is required to test the size of such differential effects and any subsequent effect on decision-making systems such as health technology assessment systems. Collaboration between health economics and the mental health sciences is crucial for achieving mental-physical health parity in evaluative frameworks and, ultimately, improving population mental health.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) or cardiovascular risk factors have been associated with an increased risk of complications following hospitalisation with COVID-19, but their impact on the rate of recovery following discharge is not known. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the rate of patient-perceived recovery following hospitalisation with COVID-19 was affected by the presence of CVD or cardiovascular risk factors. METHODS: In a multicentre prospective cohort study, patients were recruited following discharge from the hospital with COVID-19 undertaking two comprehensive assessments at 5 months and 12 months. Patients were stratified by the presence of either CVD or cardiovascular risk factors prior to hospitalisation with COVID-19 and compared with controls with neither. Full recovery was determined by the response to a patient-perceived evaluation of full recovery from COVID-19 in the context of physical, physiological and cognitive determinants of health. RESULTS: From a total population of 2545 patients (38.8% women), 472 (18.5%) and 1355 (53.2%) had CVD or cardiovascular risk factors, respectively. Compared with controls (n=718), patients with CVD and cardiovascular risk factors were older and more likely to have had severe COVID-19. Full recovery was significantly lower at 12 months in patients with CVD (adjusted OR (aOR) 0.62, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.89) and cardiovascular risk factors (aOR 0.66, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.86). CONCLUSION: Patients with CVD or cardiovascular risk factors had a delayed recovery at 12 months following hospitalisation with COVID-19. Targeted interventions to reduce the impact of COVID-19 in patients with cardiovascular disease remain an unmet need. TRAIL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN10980107.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Lower cerebral blood flow (CBF) is associated with cardiovascular disease and vascular risk factors, and is increasingly acknowledged as an important contributor to cognitive decline and dementia. In this cross-sectional study, we examined the association between CBF and cognitive functioning in a community-based, multi-ethnic cohort. Methods: From the SABRE (Southall and Brent Revisited) study, we included 214 European, 151 South Asian and 87 African Caribbean participants (71 +/- 5 years; 39%F). We used 3T pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling to estimate whole-brain, hematocrit corrected CBF. We measured global cognition and three cognitive domains (memory, executive functioning/attention and language) with a neuropsychological test battery. Associations were investigated using linear regression analyses, adjusted for demographic variables, vascular risk factors and MRI measures. Results: Across groups, we found an association between higher CBF and better performance on executive functioning/attention (standardized ss [stss] = 0.11, p < 0.05). Stratification for ethnicity showed associations between higher CBF and better performance on memory and executive functioning/attention in the white European group (stss = 0.14; p < 0.05 and stss = 0.18; p < 0.01 respectively), associations were weaker in the South Asian and African Caribbean groups. Conclusions: In a multi-ethnic community-based cohort we showed modest associations between CBF and cognitive functioning. In particular, we found an association between higher CBF and better performance on executive functioning/attention and memory in the white European group. The observations are consistent with the proposed role of cerebral hemodynamics in cognitive decline.},

Using computation fluid dynamics combined with CT images, the flow patterns and wall shear stress (WSS) in the AAA of a patient were studied. AAA geometry was obtained from images acquired during a routine CT scan, and a realistic abdominal aortic flow waveform was used as an upstream boundary condition. The computational results showed the presence of multiple flow recirculation zones and overall low WSS in the bulge of the aneurysm. This may provide some insight into the growth of thrombus in AAA.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a dilatation of the aortic wall, which can rupture, if left untreated. Previous work has shown that, maximum diameter is not a reliable determinant of AAA rupture. However, it is currently the most widely accepted indicator. Wall stress may be a better indicator and promising patient specific results from structural models using static pressure, have been published. Since flow and pressure inside AAA are non-uniform, the dynamic interaction between the pulsatile flow and wall may influence the predicted wall stress. The purpose of the present study was to compare static and dynamic wall stress analysis of patient specific AAAs. METHOD: Patient-specific AAA models were created from CT scans of three patients. Two simulations were performed on each lumen model, fluid structure interaction (FSI) model and static structural (SS) model. The AAA wall was created by dilating the lumen with a uniform 1.5 mm thickness, and was modeled as a non-linear hyperelastic material. Commercial finite element code Adina 8.2 was used for all simulations. The results were compared between the FSI and SS simulations. RESULTS: Results are presented for the wall stress patterns, wall shear stress patterns, pressure, and velocity fields within the lumen. It is demonstrated that including fluid flow can change local wall stresses slightly. However, as far as the peak wall stress is concerned, this effect is negligible as the difference between SS and FSI models is less than 1%. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that fully coupled FSI simulation, which requires considerable computational power to run, adds little to rupture risk prediction. This justifies the use of SS models in previous studies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Observational epidemiological studies have reported an association between childhood adiposity and altered cardiac morphology and function in later life. However, whether this is due to a direct consequence of being overweight during childhood has been difficult to establish, particularly as accounting for other measures of body composition throughout the lifecourse can be exceptionally challenging. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we used human genetics to investigate this using a causal inference technique known as lifecourse Mendelian randomization. This approach allowed us to evaluate the effect of childhood body size on 11 measures of right heart and pulmonary circulation independent of other anthropometric traits at various stages in the lifecourse. We found strong evidence that childhood body size has a direct effect on an enlarged right heart structure in later life (eg, right ventricular end-diastolic volume: beta=0.24 [95% CI, 0.15-0.33]; P=3x10(-7)) independent of adulthood body size. In contrast, childhood body size effects on maximum ascending aorta diameter attenuated upon accounting for body size in adulthood, suggesting that this effect is likely attributed to individuals remaining overweight into later life. Effects of childhood body size on pulmonary artery traits and measures of right atrial function became weaker upon accounting for adulthood fat-free mass and childhood height, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that, although childhood body size has a long-term influence on an enlarged heart structure in adulthood, associations with the other structural components of the cardiovascular system and their function may be largely attributed to body composition at other stages in the lifecourse.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The retina has a high oxygen consumption, making it particularly vulnerable to vascular insults, impairing oxygen and nutrient supply. The aim of this study was to develop a detailed computational model for quantitative analysis of blood flow and oxygen transport in physiologically realistic retinal arterial networks. Such a model will allow us to examine the effect of topological changes in retinal vasculature on hemodynamics and oxygen distribution in the retinal circulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Navier-Stokes equations for blood flow and the convection-diffusion equation for oxygen transfer were solved numerically to obtain detailed blood flow and oxygen distribution patterns in a retinal arterial tree. The geometrical outlines of the central retinal artery and its major branches were extracted from retinal images acquired from a healthy young adult by a Zeiss FF450+ fundus camera. The reconstructed subject-specific retinal arterial network geometry was combined with a structured tree model for the distal peripheral vessels. The non-Newtonian rheological properties of blood were incorporated by using an empirical viscosity model to account for the Fahraeus-Lindqvist effect. RESULTS: The model predicted pressure drops in the range of 11-14.6 mmHg between the inlet and outlets of the reconstructed network and non-uniform oxygen tension, which varied with the vessel diameter and distance from the optic disc. The mean oxygen saturation in retinal arteries was 93.1% for vessels larger than 50 mum in diameter and 82.2% for smaller arterioles. CONCLUSIONS: Our numerical results are in good agreement with in vivo measurements reported in the literature, demonstrating the potential of our model for prediction of oxygen distribution and intravascular oxygen tension profiles in the retinal arterial network. This paves the way for investigating the effects of parameter variation, simulating cases not available from experimental studies.},

Computational analysis of blood flow was performed, which accounted for the non-Newtonian rheological properties of blood and peripheral vessel resistance. The results suggested that the rate of energy required to maintain the blood flow and wall metabolism is much lower for normal subjects than for hypertensives, with the latter requiring 49.2% more energy for an entire retinal arteriolar tree. Among the several morphological factors, length-to-diameter ratio was found to have the most significant influence on the overall energy requirement.},

A 2D image-based steady computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation was applied to investigate hemodynamics in the retinal circulation. The 2D geometry of a retinal arterial network was obtained from a photographic image captured in vivo by a fundus camera. A peripheral circulation model described as a structured fractal tree was implemented at each outlet to represent the effect of peripheral minor vessels in providing boundary conditions for the simulation. Our simulation results show that retinal blood flow appears uniformly distributed in the network of a healthy subject, and the fractal tree boundary conditions are suitable for the retinal arterial network model.

Although a number of studies have been performed on the quantitative assessment of the geometrical patterns of the retinal vasculature, previous work has been confined to 2 dimensional (2D) analyses. In this paper, we present an approach to obtain a 3D reconstruction of the retinal arteries from a pair of 2D retinal images acquired in vivo. A simple essential matrix based self-calibration approach was employed for the "fundus camera-eye" system. Vessel segmentation was performed using a semi-automatic approach and correspondence between points from different images was calculated. The results of 3D reconstruction show the centreline of retinal vessels and their 3D curvature clearly. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the retinal vessels is feasible and may be useful in future studies of the retinal vasculature in disease.},

Nevertheless, such a modeling approach involves a number of uncertainties associated with various stages of the process. The present study is concerned with the reproducibility of geometry reconstruction, one of the most crucial steps in the modeling process. The reproducibility test was conducted on the right carotid bifurcation of eight normal human subjects, each of whom were scanned twice using the same MR protocol with an in-plane resolution of 0.625 mm. Models constructed from different scans of the same subject were compared and assessed using four quantitative measures: centerline distance, cross-sectional area, contour shape factors, and mean radius difference. The difference in the maximum carotid bulb area between the two scans was found to be <8.1% for all subjects. Shape factors (measuring the dissimilarity between two contours) of <10% were achieved in most of the common carotid arteries (CCAs) and internal carotid arteries (ICAs). The mean radius difference between the two scans was <0.4 mm for all subjects. Among the three vessels, the geometry of CCA was well reproduced by the reconstruction procedure in most of the cases, while the external carotid artery (ECA) showed the worst reproducibility.

   abstract = {The carotid bifurcation is a common site for clinically significant atherosclerosis, and the development of this disease may be influenced by the local hemodynamic environment. It has been shown that vessel geometry and pulsatile flow conditions are the predominant factors that determine the detailed blood flow patterns at the carotid bifurcation. This study was initiated to quantify the velocity profiles and wall shear stress (WSS) distributions in an anatomically true model of the human carotid bifurcation using data acquired from magnetic resonance (MR) imaging scans of an individual subject. A numerical simulation approach combining the image processing and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques was developed. Individual vascular anatomy and pulsatile flow conditions were all incorporated into the computer model. It was found that the geometry of the carotid bifurcation was highly complex, involving helical curvature and out-of-plane branching. These geometrical features resulted in patterns of flow and wall shear stress significantly different from those found in simplified planar carotid bifurcation models. Comparisons between the predicted flow patterns and MR measurement demonstrated good quantitative agreement.},

While platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced chemotaxis of human vascular smooth muscle cells (HVSMC) is inhibited by both wortmannin and LY294002, DNA synthesis is only inhibited by LY294002. Serum-induced DNA synthesis however is inhibited by LY294002, wortmannin and rapamycin. Similarly PDGF-induced protein kinase B (PKB) activation is inhibited by LY294002 but not by wortmannin or rapamycin.

   abstract = {Thrombospondin-1 is a large matricellular protein that acts as a pleiotropic growth factor for human vascular smooth muscle cells, and may play a role in the progression of vascular disease. Although we have previously demonstrated the dependence of both thrombospondin-1-stimulated cell chemotaxis and proliferation on tyrosine kinases, the receptor mechanisms involved remain obscure. This investigation aims to determine the nature of the receptor(s) involved in the cellular responses to thrombospondin-1. Cellular signals were identified by western blotting following cell stimulation, while cellular responses were assessed by measuring DNA synthesis and chemotaxis. These data demonstrate that thrombospondin-1-induced cell chemotaxis can be inhibited by a peptide containing the Arg-Gly-Asp motif, a function-blocking alpha(v)beta(3) antibody, a function-blocking integrin-associated protein (IAP) antibody and pertussis toxin, while thrombospondin-1-stimulated DNA synthesis is inhibited by a function-blocking alpha(3)beta(1) antibody. Similarly the Arg-Gly-Asp-containing peptide inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, but does not significantly affect tyrosine phosphorylation, or activation, of extracellular-regulated kinase. These data suggest that soluble thrombospondin-1 interacts with human vascular smooth muscle cells via two independent and separable receptor-binding sites, to differentially stimulate cell chemotaxis and DNA synthesis.},

   abstract = {Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is a matricellular protein that is expressed in negligible amounts in normal blood vessels but is markedly upregulated in vascular injury. Although TSP-1 can act as a pleiotropic regulator for human vascular smooth muscle cells (HVSMCs), the intracellular signaling pathways stimulated by this protein remain obscure. In cultured HVSMCs derived from saphenous vein, TSP-1 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of cellular proteins, with a complex temporal pattern of activation. Immunoprecipitation techniques have identified the early tyrosine-phosphorylated signals as being the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI 3-K showed a biphasic response to TSP-1 stimulation, which corresponded to a biphasic activation of the lipid kinase. Treatment with both wortmannin and LY294002 inhibited PI 3-K activity of HVSMCs but did not affect tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 regulatory subunit. TSP-1-stimulated FAK phosphorylation, however, was substantially reduced by these inhibitors, as was the TSP-1-induced chemotaxis of these cells. These results suggest that activation of PI 3-K is an early signal induced by TSP-1 and is critical for chemotaxis. Activation of this kinase precedes and may occur upstream from FAK phosphorylation, although the nature of the interaction between these 2 enzymes remains obscure.},

   abstract = {The phosphoinositol-phospholipase C (PLC) family of enzymes consists of a number of isoforms, each of which has different cellular functions. PLCgamma1 is primarily linked to tyrosine kinase transduction pathways, whereas PLCdelta1 has been associated with a number of regulatory proteins, including those controlling the cell cycle. Recent studies have shown a central role of PLC in cell organisation and in regulating a wide array of cellular responses. It is of importance to define the precise role of each isoform, and how this changes the functional outcome of the cell. Here we investigated differences in PLC isoform levels and activity in relation to differentiation of human and rat vascular smooth muscle cells. Using Western blotting and PLC activity assay, we show that PLCdelta1 and PLCgamma1 are the predominant isoforms in randomly cycling human vascular smooth muscle cells (HVSMCs). Growth arrest of HVSMCs for seven days of serum deprivation was consistently associated with increases in PLCdelta1 and SM alpha-actin, whereas there were no changes in PLCgamma1 immuno-reactivity. Organ culture of rat mesenteric arteries in serum free media (SFM), a model of de-differentiation, led to a loss of contractility as well as a loss of contractile proteins (SM alpha-actin and calponin) and PLCdelta1, and no change in PLCgamma1 immuno-reactivity. Taken together, these data indicate that PLCdelta1 is the predominant PLC isoform in vascular smooth muscle, and confirm that PLCdelta1 expression is affected by conditions that affect the cell cycle, differentiation status and contractile function.},

   abstract = {Diabetes aggravates the impact of elevated BP (blood pressure) on the microcirculation, and people of African ancestry with diabetes are more susceptible to microvascular damage than Europeans. In the present study, we investigated possible differences in the retinal microcirculation in people of European and African-Caribbean ethnicity with diabetes that might account for this. A total of 51 subjects with Type 2 diabetes (age 40-65 years; 25 male; 29 African-Caribbean) were studied. Clinic and 24 h ambulatory BP, and fasting glucose, insulin and lipids were measured. Digital retinal images were analysed using custom-written semi-automatic software to determine: LDR (length/diameter ratio) and AVR (arteriolar/venular diameter ratio), branching angles, vessel tortuosity and NT (number of terminal vessel branches). Arterioles were narrower in European people with diabetes than in African-Caribbean people with diabetes [mean (S.D.) arteriolar diameter, 76 (7) compared with 82 (11) microm respectively (P=0.03); arteriolar LDR, 28.1 (8.5) compared with 23.7 (7.0) respectively (P=0.046); and AVR, 0.66 (0.21) compared with 0.90 (0.36) respectively (P=0.028)]. Ethnic differences in arteriolar LDR, arteriolar diameter and AVR were not explained by differences in BP, but were attenuated by adjustment for the duration of diabetes. There was no significant relationship between BP and arteriolar narrowing in the group as a whole, although the relationship between arteriolar LDR and systolic BP was stronger in Europeans than African-Caribbeans [beta=0.08 (0.07) compared with beta=0.03 (0.06); P=0.03]. In conclusion, in the presence of diabetes, a relationship between BP and retinal arteriolar diameter was not evident and implies impaired small artery remodelling in the presence of diabetes. African-Caribbean people with diabetes have wider retinal arterioles and this could contribute to enhanced microvascular damage in this ethnic group.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whether earlier onset of puberty is associated with higher cardiovascular risk in early adulthood is not well understood. Our objective was to examine the association between puberty timing and markers of cardiovascular structure and function at age 25 years. METHODS: We conducted a prospective birth cohort study using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Participants were born between April 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992. Exposure of interest was age at peak height velocity (aPHV), an objective and validated growth-based measure of puberty onset. Outcome measures included cardiovascular structure and function at age 25 years: carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and relative wall thickness (RWT), pulse wave velocity (PWV) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Multiple imputation was used to impute missing data on covariates and outcomes. Linear regression was used to examine the association between aPHV and each measure of cardiac structure and function, adjusting for maternal age, gestational age, household social class, maternal education, mother's partner's education, breastfeeding, parity, birthweight, maternal body mass index, maternal marital status, maternal prenatal smoking status and height and fat mass at age 9. All analyses were stratified by sex. RESULTS: A total of 2752-4571 participants were included in the imputed analyses. A 1-year older aPHV was not strongly associated with markers of cardiac structure and function in males and females at 25 years and most results spanned the null value. In adjusted analyses, a 1-year older aPHV was associated with 0.003 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00001, 0.006) and 0.0008 mm (95% CI - 0.002, 0.003) higher CIMT; 0.02 m/s (95% CI - 0.05, 0.09) and 0.02 m/s (95% CI - 0.04, 0.09) higher PWV; and 0.003 mmHg (95% CI - 0.60, 0.60) and 0.13 mmHg (95% CI - 0.44, 0.70) higher SBP, among males and females, respectively. A 1-year older aPHV was associated with - 0.55 g/m(2.7) (95% CI - 0.03, - 1.08) and - 0.89 g/m(2.7) (95% CI - 0.45, - 1.34) lower LVMI and - 0.001 (95% CI - 0.006, 0.002) and - 0.002 (95% CI - 0.006, 0.002) lower RWT among males and females. CONCLUSIONS: Earlier puberty is unlikely to have a major impact on pre-clinical cardiovascular risk in early adulthood.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study investigated whether wave reflection measured by wave intensity analysis predicts future cardiovascular events in individuals with hypertension and sought to establish whether this relationship is independent of other cardiovascular risk factors and is associated with evidence of increased load on the left ventricle. BACKGROUND: Wave reflection may impose an additional load on the left ventricle, and augmentation index, a surrogate of wave reflection, has been reported to predict cardiovascular events in some, but not all studies. METHODS: Measurements of brachial and carotid blood pressure (BP) measurement, carotid ultrasound, echocardiography, and blood chemistry analyses were performed on 259 ASCOT (Anglo Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial) participants approximately 1 year after randomization, and wave intensity analysis was used to calculate wave reflection index (WRI), the ratio of peak forward to peak backward pressure (P(b)/P(f)), and carotid augmentation index (cAI(x)). All participants were followed up for a median period of 5.9 years, accruing 33 cardiovascular events. RESULTS: WRI, P(b)/P(f), and to a lesser extent, cAI(x), were correlated. WRI predicted cardiovascular events (hazard ratio: 2.10; 95% confidence interval: 1.10 to 3.99; p = 0.02) in an unadjusted model. Multivariate analysis showed that this association was independent of BP. P(b)/P(f) and cAI(x) did not significantly predict cardiovascular events. WRI was also positively associated with increased left ventricular mass index and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide adjusted for age and sex, and these associations were independent of BP or other cardiovascular risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Higher wave reflection predicts future cardiovascular events independent of conventional risk factors in people with treated hypertension.},

   abstract = {Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce cardiovascular events in hypertensive subjects, but their effect on carotid BP, pressure augmentation, and wave reflection is unknown. We compared the effect of atorvastatin with placebo in a substudy of the lipid-lowering arm of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT-LLA). Hypertensive patients (n=142; age=43 to 79 years; 127 male) with total cholesterol < or = 6.5 mmol/L were randomized to atorvastatin 10 mg or placebo. Carotid BP and flow velocity were measured by tonometry and Doppler ultrasound. Augmentation index (carotid AI(x)) was calculated, and waveforms were separated into backward and forward components by wave intensity analysis. Brachial BP was similar in atorvastatin and placebo groups. Carotid AI(x) and augmentation pressure were significantly less in patients randomized to atorvastatin (mean [SD]: 21.7 [12.1] versus 25.9 [10.3] %; P=0.027 and 10.2 [6.5] versus 13.1 [6.6] mm Hg; P=0.016, respectively), and atorvastatin treatment was associated with significantly less wave reflection from the body. Carotid systolic BP was slightly lower in the atorvastatin group, but there was a statistically significant interaction between lipid-lowering and antihypertensive regimen with lower carotid systolic BP in patients randomized to amlodipine-based therapy and atorvastatin. Carotid wave velocity, timings of waves, and wave intensities did not differ significantly between atorvastatin and placebo groups. Atorvastatin treatment is associated with less augmentation of the carotid BP waveform and less wave reflection from the body. This could contribute to the reduction in risk of cardiovascular events by statins.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The AV delay optimization of biventricular pacemakers (cardiac resynchronization therapy) may maximize hemodynamic benefit but consumes specialist time to conduct echocardiographically. Noninvasive BP monitoring is a potentially automatable alternative, but it is unknown whether it gives the same information and similar precision (signal/noise ratio). Moreover, the immediate BP increment on optimization has been reported to decay away: it is unclear whether this is the result of an (undesirable) decrease in stroke volume or a (desirable) compensatory relief of peripheral vasoconstriction. METHODS AND RESULTS: To discriminate between these alternative mechanisms, we measured simultaneous beat-to-beat stroke volume (flow) using Doppler echocardiography, and BP using finger photoplethysmography, during and after AV delay changes from 40 to 120 ms in 19 subjects with cardiac pacemakers. BP and stroke volume both increased immediately (P<0.001, within 1 heartbeat). BP showed a clear decline a few seconds later (average rate, -0.65 mm Hg/beat; r=0.95 [95% CI, 0.86-0.98]); in contrast, stroke volume did not decline (P=0.87). The immediate BP increment correlated strongly with the stroke volume increment (r=0.74, P<0.001). The signal/noise ratio was 3-fold better for BP than stroke volume (6.8+/-3.5 versus 2.3+/-1.4; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Improving AV delay immediately increases BP, but the effect begins to decay within a few seconds. Reassuringly, this is because of compensatory vasodilatation rather than reduction in cardiac function. Pacemaker optimization will never be reliable unless there is an adequate signal/noise ratio. Using BP rather than Doppler minimizes noise. The early phase (before vascular compensation) has the richest signal lode.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Brachial systolic blood pressure (bSBP) exceeds aortic pressure by a variable amount, and estimated central systolic blood pressure (cSBP) may be a better indicator of cardiovascular risk than bSBP. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the effect of single and multiple antihypertensive agents on bSBP, cSBP and augmentation index (AIx). METHODS: A random effects meta-analysis was performed on 24 randomized controlled trials of antihypertensives with measurements of bSBP, cSBP and/or AIx. Separate analyses were performed for drug comparisons with or without placebo, and drug combinations. RESULTS: In the placebo vs. drug meta-analysis, antihypertensive therapy reduced bSBP more than cSBP and there was no statistically significant evidence of heterogeneity by drug class, although the number of individual studies was small. In placebo-adjusted drug vs. drug comparison, treatment with beta-blockers, omapatrilat and thiazide diuretics lowered cSBP significantly less than bSBP (i.e. central to brachial amplification decreased), whereas other monotherapies lowered cSBP and bSBP to similar extents. Sample sizes were too small and effect estimates insufficiently precise to allow firm conclusions to be made regarding comparisons between individual drug classes. Antihypertensive combinations that included beta-blockers decreased central to brachial amplification. beta-Blockers increased AIx, whereas all other antihypertensive agents reduced AIx to similar extents. CONCLUSIONS: A reduction in central to brachial amplification by some classes of antihypertensive drug will result in lesser reductions in cSBP despite achievement of target bSBP. This effect could contribute to differences in outcomes in randomized clinical trials when beta-blocker- and/or diuretic-based antihypertensive therapy are compared with other regimens.},

   abstract = {For disease states characterized by oscillatory ventilation, an ideal dynamic therapy would apply a counteracting oscillation in ventilation. Modulating respiratory gas transport through the circulation might allow this. We explore the ability of repetitive alternations in heart rate, using a cardiac pacemaker, to elicit oscillations in respiratory variables and discuss the potential for therapeutic exploitation. By incorporating acute cardiac output manipulations into an integrated mathematical model, we observed that a rise in cardiac output should yield a gradual rise in end-tidal CO2 and, subsequently, ventilation. An alternating pattern of cardiac output might, therefore, create oscillations in CO2 and ventilation. We studied the effect of repeated alternations in heart rate of 30 beats/min with periodicity of 60 s, on cardiac output, respiratory gases, and ventilation in 22 subjects with implanted cardiac pacemakers and stable breathing patterns. End-tidal CO2 and ventilation developed consistent oscillations with a period of 60 s during the heart rate alternations, with mean peak-to-trough relative excursions of 8.4 +/- 5.0% (P < 0.0001) and 24.4 +/- 18.8% (P < 0.0001), respectively. Furthermore, we verified the mathematical prediction that the amplitude of these oscillations would depend on those in cardiac output (r = 0.59, P = 0.001). Repetitive alternations in heart rate can elicit reproducible oscillations in end-tidal CO2 and ventilation. The size of this effect depends on the magnitude of the cardiac output response. Harnessed and timed appropriately, this cardiorespiratory mechanism might be exploited to create an active dynamic responsive pacing algorithm to counteract spontaneous respiratory oscillations, such as those causing apneic breathing disorders.},

   abstract = {Antihypertensive agents may differ in their effects on central systolic blood pressure, and this may contribute to treatment-related differences in cardiovascular outcomes. In a substudy of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcome Trial, we investigated whether directly measured carotid systolic blood pressure differed between people randomized to amlodipine- and atenolol-based therapies and whether this is accounted for by differences in wave reflection patterns. Additional analysis was undertaken to establish whether differences in carotid systolic blood pressure predicted left ventricular mass, accounting for between-treatment differences in left ventricular mass index. Blood pressure and flow velocity were measured in the right carotid artery of 259 patients. Wave intensity analysis was used to separate and quantify forward and backward waves. Brachial blood pressure did not differ significantly between groups, but carotid systolic blood pressure (127 [12] versus 133 [15] mm Hg; P<0.001), the ratio of backward:forward pressure (0.48 [0.17] versus 0.53 [0.19]; P=0.01), and wave reflection index (19.8% [10.9%] versus 23.3% [13.3%]; P=0.02) were significantly lower in patients randomized to amlodipine-based therapy. Left ventricular mass index was also lower in this group, and adjustment for carotid blood pressure attenuated treatment differences to a greater extent than brachial blood pressure. Carotid systolic blood pressure was also a significant independent predictor of left ventricular mass index in a multivariate model. Carotid systolic blood pressure is lower in people randomized to amlodipine-based compared with atenolol-based treatment despite there being no significant difference in brachial blood pressure. This difference is attributable to a lesser magnitude of wave reflection in patients randomized to the amlodipine-based regimen.},

We show that the ITK implementation achieves high quality segmentations with markedly improved computational efficiency. The ITK version has greater segmentation accuracy, from 0.94 to 0.96, than the Matlab version due to a decrease in FPR values and it is between 8 and 12 times faster than the original version. Furthermore, the ITK implementation is able to segment high-resolution images in an acceptable timescale.},

   abstract = {A semi-automatic method to measure and quantify geometrical and topological properties of continuous vascular trees in clinical fundus images is described. Measurements are made from binary images obtained with a previously described segmentation process. The skeletons of the segmented trees are produced by thinning,ff branch and crossing points are identified and segments of the trees are labeled and stored as a chain code. The operator selects a tree to be measured and decides if it is an arterial or venous tree. An automatic process then measures the lengths, areas and angles of the individual segments of the tree. Geometrical data and the connectivity information between branches from continuous retinal vessel trees are tabulated. A number of geometrical properties and topological indexes are derived. Vessel diameters and branching angles are validated against manual measurements and several derived geometrical and topological properties are extracted from red-free fundus images of ten normotensive and ten age- and sex-matched hypertensive subjects and compared with previously reported results.},

   abstract = {The morphology of the retinal blood vessels can be an important indicator for diseases like diabetes, hypertension and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Thus, the measurement of changes in morphology of arterioles and venules can be of diagnostic value. Here we present a method to automatically segment retinal blood vessels based upon multiscale feature extraction. This method overcomes the problem of variations in contrast inherent in these images by using the first and second spatial derivatives of the intensity image that gives information about vessel topology. This approach also enables the detection of blood vessels of different widths, lengths and orientations. The local maxima over scales of the magnitude of the gradient and the maximum principal curvature of the Hessian tensor are used in a multiple pass region growing procedure. The growth progressively segments the blood vessels using feature information together with spatial information. The algorithm is tested on red-free and fluorescein retinal images, taken from two local and two public databases. Comparison with first public database yields values of 75.05% true positive rate (TPR) and 4.38% false positive rate (FPR). Second database values are of 72.46% TPR and 3.45% FPR. Our results on both public databases were comparable in performance with other authors. However, we conclude that these values are not sensitive enough so as to evaluate the performance of vessel geometry detection. Therefore we propose a new approach that uses measurements of vessel diameters and branching angles as a validation criterion to compare our segmented images with those hand segmented from public databases. Comparisons made between both hand segmented images from public databases showed a large inter-subject variability on geometric values. A last evaluation was made comparing vessel geometric values obtained from our segmented images between red-free and fluorescein paired images with the latter as the "ground truth". Our results demonstrated that borders found by our method are less biased and follow more consistently the border of the vessel and therefore they yield more confident geometric values.},

Initially, the available handheld devices were compared using a Zeiss model eye incorporating a USAF resolution test chart to assess their optical properties. The only suitable camera of the five evaluated was the Horus DEC 200. This device was then subjected to a detailed evaluation in which images in human eyes taken from the handheld camera were compared in a quantitative analysis with those of the same eye from a Canon CR-DGi retinal desktop camera. We found that the Horus DEC 200 exhibited shortcomings in capturing images of human eyes by comparison with the Canon. More images were rejected as being unevaluable or suffering failures in automatic segmentation than with the Canon, and even after exclusion of affected images, the Horus yielded lower measurements of vessel density than the Canon. A number of issues affecting handheld cameras in general and some features of the Horus in particular have been identified that might contribute to the observed differences in performance. Some potential mitigations are discussed which might yield improvements in performance, thus potentially facilitating use of handheld retinal imaging devices for quantitative retinal microvascular measurements.},

   abstract = {The optic disc (OD) in retinal fundus images is widely used as a reference in computer-based systems for the measurement of the severity of retinal disease. A number of algorithms have been published in the past 5 years to locate and measure the OD in digital fundus images. Our proposed algorithm, automatically: (i) uses the three channels (RGB) of the digital colour image to locate the region of interest (ROI) where the OD lies, (ii) measures the Shannon information content per channel in the ROI, to decide which channel is most appropriate for searching for the OD centre using the circular Hough transform. A series of evaluations were undertaken to test our hypothesis that using the three channels gives a better performance than a single channel. Three different databases were used for evaluation purposes with a total of 2,371 colour images giving a misdetection error of 3% in the localisation of the centre of the OD. We find that the area determined by our algorithm which assumes that the OD is circular, is similar to that found by other algorithms that detected the shape of the OD. Five metrics were measured for comparison with other recent studies. Combining the two databases where expert delineation of the OD is available (1,240 images), the average results for our multispectral algorithm are: TPR = 0.879, FPR = 0.003, Accuracy = 0.994, Overlap = 80.6% and Dice index = 0.878.},

   abstract = {AIM: Cross-sectional studies reported associations between short leucocyte telomere length (LTL) and measures of vascular and cardiac damage. However, the contribution of LTL dynamics to the age-related process of cardiovascular (CV) remodelling remains unknown. In this study, we explored whether the rate of LTL shortening can predict CV phenotypes over 10-year follow-up and the influence of established CV risk factors on this relationship. METHODS AND RESULTS: All the participants from the MRC National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) with measures of LTL and traditional CV risk factors at 53 and 60-64 years and common carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), cardiac mass and left ventricular function at 60-64 years were included. LTL was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and available at both time points in 1033 individuals. While LTL at 53 years was not linked with any CV phenotype at 60-64 years, a negative association was found between LTL and cIMT at 60-64 years (beta = -0.017, P = 0.015). However, the strongest association was found between rate of telomere shortening between 53 and 60-64 years and values of cIMT at 60-64 years (beta = -0.020, P = 0.006). This association was not affected by adjustment for traditional CV risk factors. Cardiac measurements were not associated with cross-sectional or longitudinal measures of LTL. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the rate of progression of cellular ageing in late midlife (reflected by the rate of LTL attrition) relates to vascular damage, independently from contribution of CV risk factor exposure.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between long-term exposure to whole body or central obesity and cognitive function, as well as its potential determinants, remain controversial. In this study, we assessed (1) the potential impact of 30 years exposure to different patterns of whole body and central adiposity on cognitive function at 60-64 years, (2) whether trajectories of central adiposity can provide additional information on later cognitive function compared to trajectories of whole body adiposity, and (3) the influence of vascular phenotypes on these associations. METHODS: The study included 1249 participants from the prospective cohort MRC National Survey of Health and Development. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and vascular (carotid intima-media thickness, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity) and cognitive function (memory, processing speed, reaction time) data, at 60-64 years, were used to assess the associations between different patterns of adult WC or BMI (from 36 years of age) and late midlife cognitive performance, as well as the proportion of this association explained by cardiovascular phenotypes. RESULTS: Longer exposure to elevated WC was related to lower memory performance (p < 0.001 for both) and longer choice reaction time (p = 0.003). A faster gain of WC between 36 and 43 years of age was associated with the largest change in reaction time and memory test (P < 0.05 for all). Similar associations were observed when patterns of WC were substituted with patterns of BMI, but when WC and BMI were included in the same model, only patterns of WC remained significantly associated with cognitive function. Participants who dropped one BMI category and maintained a lower BMI had similar memory performance to those of normal weight during the whole follow-up. Conversely, those who dropped and subsequently regained one BMI category had a memory function similar to those with 30 years exposure to elevated BMI. Adjustment for vascular phenotypes, levels of cardiovascular risk factors, physical activity, education, childhood cognition and socioeconomic position did not affect these associations. CONCLUSIONS: Longer exposure to elevated WC or BMI and faster WC or BMI gains between 36 and 43 years are related to lower cognitive function at 60-64 years. Patterns of WC in adulthood could provide additional information in predicting late midlife cognitive function than patterns of BMI. The acquisition of an adverse cardiovascular phenotype associated with adiposity is unlikely to account for these relationships.},

   abstract = {The commonest causes of dementia are Alzheimer's disease and vascular cognitive impairment. Although these conditions have been viewed as distinct entities, there is increasing evidence that neurodegenerative and vascular pathologies interact or overlap to cause cognitive decline, and that at least in some cases individuals at risk of cognitive decline exhibit abnormal cardiovascular physiology long before emergence of disease. However, the mechanisms linking haemodynamic disturbances with cognitive impairment and the various pathologies that cause dementia are poorly understood. A sub-sample of 502 participants from the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) have participated in the first visit of a neuroscience sub-study referred to as Insight 46, where clinical, cognitive, imaging, and lifestyle data have been collected for the purpose of elucidating the pathological changes preceding dementia. This paper outlines the cardiovascular phenotyping performed in the follow-up visit of Insight 46, with the study participants now aged 74. In addition to standard cardiovascular assessments such as blood pressure measurements, echocardiography, and electrocardiography (ECG), functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been included to provide an assessment of cerebrovascular function. A detailed description of the fNIRS protocol along with preliminary results from pilot data is presented. The combination of lifestyle data, brain structure/function, cognitive performance, and cardiovascular health obtained not only from Insight 46, but also from the whole NSHD provides an exciting opportunity to advance our understanding of the cardiovascular mechanisms underlying dementia and cognitive decline, and identify novel targets for intervention.},

   abstract = {There is an increasing body of evidence suggesting that vascular disease could contribute to cognitive decline and overt dementia. Of particular interest is atherosclerosis, as it is not only associated with dementia, but could be a potential mechanism through which cardiovascular disease directly impacts brain health. In this work, we evaluated the differences in functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based measures of brain activation, task performance, and the change in central hemodynamics (mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR)) during a Stroop color-word task in individuals with atherosclerosis, defined as bilateral carotid plaques (n = 33) and healthy age-matched controls (n = 33). In the healthy control group, the left prefrontal cortex (LPFC) was the only region showing evidence of activation when comparing the incongruous with the nominal Stroop test. A smaller extent of brain activation was observed in the Plaque group compared with the healthy controls (1) globally, as measured by oxygenated hemoglobin (p = 0.036) and (2) in the LPFC (p = 0.02) and left sensorimotor cortices (LMC)(p = 0.008) as measured by deoxygenated hemoglobin. There were no significant differences in HR, MAP, or task performance (both in terms of the time required to complete the task and number of errors made) between Plaque and control groups. These results suggest that carotid atherosclerosis is associated with altered functional brain activation patterns despite no evidence of impaired performance of the Stroop task or central hemodynamic changes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiac assessment is an important part of risk stratification in hypertensive patients. Left ventricular hypertrophy in particular is a powerful predictor of subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Previous studies assessing haemodynamic factors that may be responsible for cardiac changes in hypertensive patients have been performed in those previously treated for hypertension. To investigate more fully these haemodynamic relationships, a large group of previously untreated patients were studied. METHODS: Ninety-eight previously untreated hypertensive patients underwent electrocardiography, two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography, 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and exercise stress testing. RESULTS: The left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was more closely related to mean 24 h than to clinic blood pressures (24 h systolic r = 0.48, P < 0.01; 24 h diastolic r = 0.49, P < 0.01; clinic systolic r = 0.28, P < 0.01; clinic diastolic r = 0.31, P < 0.01). In addition, the systolic nocturnal blood pressure dip was found to be inversely related to LVMI in men (r = -0.32, P < 0.01). Of the indices of left ventricular diastolic function, age (r = -0.64, P < 0.01), heart rate (r = -0.25, P = 0.02) and LVMI (r = -0.22, P = 0.02) were independently related to the E-A ratio. Age (r = 0.40, P < 0.01), blood pressure (systolic r = 0.39, P < 0.01; diastolic r = 0.43, P < 0.01), the nocturnal blood pressure dip (systolic r = -0.38, P < 0.01, diastolic r = -0.31, P < 0.01) and LVMI (r = 0.37, P < 0.01) were independently related to the isovolumic relaxation time. CONCLUSIONS: Blood pressure was the only independent determinant of LVMI; nocturnal blood pressure may be particularly important in men. Age and both haemodynamic and structural factors are independent determinants of parameters of left ventricular diastolic function in hypertensive patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: An increased carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) has been found to be associated with a number of cardiovascular risk factors such as age, hypertension, cigarette smoking, hypercholesterolaemia and left ventricular hypertrophy. Our objective was to assess whether carotid intima-media thickness in hypertensive patients could be reduced by antihypertensive therapy. METHODS: 13 hypertensive patients, 10 previously untreated, were examined using carotid ultrasonography and echocardiography at baseline and then at 8 weeks and 39 weeks after commencement of antihypertensive therapy with ramipril and the second-line addition of felodipine. RESULTS: By the end of the study significant regression of IMT (0.1(0.05-0.16) mm, F-value 10.2, P < 0.01) and left ventricular mass index had occurred (25(10.7-39.3) g/m2, F-value 9.7, P < 0.01). The reduction in IMT was significantly related to the reduction in mean arterial pressure, r = 0.55, P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Antihypertensive therapy with ramipril and felodipine causes regression of IMT in hypertensive patients, probably chiefly through blood pressure reduction. Large prospective studies are required to assess whether a reduction in IMT results in a reduction in morbidity and mortality.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Elevated urinary 11-dehydro thromboxane B2 (TxB2), a measure of thromboxane A2 formation in vivo, predicts future atherothrombotic events. To further understand this relationship, the genetic determinants of 11-dehydro TxB2 and their associations with cardiovascular morbidity were investigated in this study. METHODS: Genome-wide and targeted genetic association studies of urinary 11-dehydro TxB2 were conducted in 806 Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) participants. RESULTS: The strongest associations were in PPARGC1B (rs4235745, rs32582, rs10515638) and CNTN4 (rs10510230, rs4684343), these 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were independently associated with 11-dehydro TxB2 formation. Haplotypes of 11-dehydro TxB2 increasing alleles for both PPARGC1B and CNTN4 were significantly associated with 11-dehydro TxB2, explaining 5.2% and 4.5% of the variation in the whole cohort, and 8.8% and 7.9% in participants not taking aspirin, respectively. In a second ASCOT population (n = 6199), addition of these 5 SNPs significantly improved the covariate-only Cox proportional hazards model for cardiovascular events (chisq = 14.7, p=0.01). Two of the risk alleles associated with increased urinary 11-dehydro TxB2 were individually associated with greater incidences of cardiovascular events - rs10515638 (HR = 1.31, p=0.01) and rs10510230 (HR = 1.25, p=0.007); effect sizes were larger in those not taking aspirin. CONCLUSIONS: PPARGC1B and CNTN4 genotypes are associated with elevated thromboxane A2 formation and with an excess of cardiovascular events. Aspirin appears to blunt these associations. If specific protection of PPARGC1B and CNTN4 variant carriers by aspirin is confirmed by additional studies, PPARGC1B and CNTN4 genotyping could potentially assist in clinical decision making regarding the use of aspirin in primary prevention.},

   abstract = {LVH (left ventricular hypertrophy) is associated with impaired coronary vascular reserve. In the present study, we examined the effect of pressure-overload hypertrophy on vasorelaxant responses of guinea-pig isolated coronary small arteries and compared them with mesenteric small arteries. Pressure-overload was induced by banding the ascending aorta of guinea-pigs. Haemodynamics, and ventricular, atrial and lung weights were measured 168 days after banding. Isolated coronary and mesenteric small arteries were contracted with a thromboxane mimetic (U46619) and relaxation to ACH (acetylcholine), ISO (isoprenaline), FSK (forskolin) and SNP (sodium nitroprusside) was examined. Arterial wall morphology was examined by light microscopy. Aortic banding reduced cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance; atrial, ventricular and lung weights were increased. Coronary artery adventitial and medial thickness were increased, but mesenteric arterial wall morphology was unaffected. Coronary artery relaxation to ACH, ISO, FSK and SNP were reduced in banded animals. In contrast, relaxation of mesenteric arteries to ACH, FSK and SNP were unaffected by banding, although ISO-induced relaxation was reduced. A COX (cyclo-oxygenase) inhibitor, indomethacin, had no effect on coronary artery responses to ACH in banded or sham animals, but the differences in relaxation of coronary arteries between banded and sham animals were no longer significant following pre-incubation with the NO inhibitors L-NMMA (N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine) and oxyhaemoglobin. In conclusion, pressure-overload-induced LVH causes impaired relaxation of small coronary arteries to endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxants. These findings are indicative of alterations in vascular smooth muscle responsiveness to vasodilators. Impairment of coronary arterial vasodilation may contribute to the reduced coronary vascular reserve seen in LVH.},

   abstract = {We examine the potential to treat unstable ventilatory control (seen in periodic breathing, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, and central sleep apnea) with carefully controlled dynamic administration of supplementary CO(2), aiming to reduce ventilatory oscillations with minimum increment in mean CO(2). We used a standard mathematical model to explore the consequences of phasic CO(2) administration, with different timing and dosing algorithms. We found an optimal time window within the ventilation cycle (covering approximately 1/6 of the cycle) during which CO(2) delivery reduces ventilatory fluctuations by >95%. Outside that time, therapy is dramatically less effective: indeed, for more than two-thirds of the cycle, therapy increases ventilatory fluctuations >30%. Efficiency of stabilizing ventilation improved when the algorithm gave a graded increase in CO(2) dose (by controlling its duration or concentration) for more severe periodic breathing. Combining gradations of duration and concentration further increased efficiency of therapy by 22%. The (undesirable) increment in mean end-tidal CO(2) caused was 300 times smaller with dynamic therapy than with static therapy, to achieve the same degree of ventilatory stabilization (0.0005 vs. 0.1710 kPa). The increase in average ventilation was also much smaller with dynamic than static therapy (0.005 vs. 2.015 l/min). We conclude that, if administered dynamically, dramatically smaller quantities of CO(2) could be used to reduce periodic breathing, with minimal adverse effects. Algorithms adjusting both duration and concentration in real time would achieve this most efficiently. If developed clinically as a therapy for periodic breathing, this would minimize excess acidosis, hyperventilation, and sympathetic overactivation, compared with static treatment.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess the validity of the DILEMMA score against instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) and evaluate its utility in rationalizing the number of patients referred for invasive physiological assessment. BACKGROUND: The DILEMMA score is a validated angiographic scoring tool incorporating minimal lumen diameter, lesion length and subtended myocardial area that has been shown to predict the functional significance of lesions as assessed by fractional flow reserve (FFR). METHODS: Patients in the DEFINE-FLAIR study who had coronary stenosis of intermediate severity were randomized to either FFR or iFR. DILEMMA score was calculated retrospectively on a subset of this cohort by operators blinded to FFR or iFR values. RESULTS: Three hundred and forty-six lesions (181 assessed by FFR; 165 by iFR) from 259 patients (mean age 66.0 years, 79% male) were included. A DILEMMA score </= 2 had a negative predictive value of 96.3% and 95.7% for identifying lesions with FFR >0.80 and iFR >0.89, respectively. A DILEMMA score >/= 9 had a positive predictive value of 88.9% and 100% for identifying lesions with FFR </=0.80 and iFR </=0.89, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic area under the curve values for DILEMMA score to predict FFR </=0.80 and iFR </=0.89 were 0.83 (95% CI 0.77-0.90) and 0.82 (0.75-0.89) respectively. A DILEMMA score </= 2 or >/=9 occurred in 172 of the 346 lesions (49.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Using DILEMMA score in patients with coronary stenosis of intermediate severity may reduce the need for pressure wire use, offering potential cost-savings and minimizing the risks associated with invasive physiological lesion assessment.},

   abstract = {Severe aortic stenosis induces abnormalities in central aortic pressure, with consequent impaired organ and tissue perfusion. Relief of aortic stenosis by transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is associated with both a short- and long-term hypertensive response. Counterintuitively, patients who are long-term normotensive post-TAVR have a worsened prognosis compared with patients with hypertension, yet the underlying mechanisms are not understood. We investigated immediate changes in invasively measured left ventricular and central aortic pressure post-TAVR in patients with severe aortic stenosis using aortic reservoir pressure, wave intensity analysis, and indices of aortic function. Fifty-four patients (mean age 83.6+/-6.2 years, 50.0% female) undergoing TAVR were included. We performed reservoir pressure and wave intensity analysis on invasively acquired pressure waveforms from the ascending aorta and left ventricle immediately pre- and post-TAVR. Following TAVR, there were increases in systolic, diastolic, mean, and pulse aortic pressures (all P<0.05). Post-TAVR reservoir pressure was unchanged (54.5+/-12.4 versus 56.6+/-14.0 mm Hg, P=0.30) whereas excess pressure increased 47% (29.0+/-10.9 versus 42.6+/-15.5 mm Hg, P<0.001). Wave intensity analysis (arbitrary units, au) demonstrated increased forward compression wave (64.9+/-35.5 versus 124.4+/-58.9, x10(3) au, P<0.001), backward compression wave (11.6+/-5.5 versus 14.4+/-6.9, x10(3) au, P=0.01) and forward expansion wave energies (43.2+/-27.3 versus 82.8+/-53.1, x10(3) au, P<0.001). Subendocardial viability ratio improved with aortic function effectively unchanged post-TAVR. Increased central aortic pressure following TAVR relates to increased transmitted power and energy to the proximal aorta with increased excess pressure but unchanged reservoir pressure. These changes provide a potential mechanism for the improved prognosis associated with relative hypertension post-TAVR.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease is common in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Computed tomography-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) is a clinically used modality for assessing coronary artery disease, however, its use has not been validated in patients with severe aortic stenosis. This study assesses the safety, feasibility, and validity of CT-FFR in patients with severe aortic stenosis. METHODS: Prospectively recruited patients underwent standard-protocol invasive FFR and coronary CT angiography (CTA). CTA images were analyzed by central core laboratory (HeartFlow, Inc) for independent evaluation of CT-FFR. CT-FFR data were compared with FFR (ischemia defined as FFR </=0.80). RESULTS: Forty-two patients (68 vessels) underwent FFR and CTA; 39 patients (92.3%) and 60 vessels (88.2%) had interpretable CTA enabling CT-FFR computation. Mean age was 76.2+/-6.7 years (71.8% male). No patients incurred complications relating to premedication, CTA, or FFR protocol. Mean FFR and CT-FFR were 0.83+/-0.10 and 0.77+/-0.14, respectively. CT calcium score was 1373.3+/-1392.9 Agatston units. On per vessel analysis, there was positive correlation between FFR and CT-FFR (Pearson correlation coefficient, R=0.64, P<0.0001). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive values were 73.9%, 78.4%, 68.0%, and 82.9%, respectively, with 76.7% diagnostic accuracy. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for CT-FFR was 0.83 (0.72-0.93, P<0.0001), which was higher than that of CTA and quantitative coronary angiography (P=0.01 and P<0.001, respectively). Bland-Altman plot showed mean bias between FFR and CT-FFR as 0.059+/-0.110. On per patient analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive, and negative predictive values were 76.5%, 77.3%, 72.2%, and 81.0% with 76.9% diagnostic accuracy. The per patient area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was 0.81 (0.67-0.95, P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: CT-FFR is safe and feasible in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Our data suggests that the diagnostic accuracy of CT-FFR in this cohort potentially enables its use in clinical practice and provides the foundation for future research into the use of CT-FFR for coronary evaluation pre-aortic valve replacement.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is common in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), although its prognostic significance is questionable. Significant CAD stratified using SYNTAX score (SS) has been associated with greater mortality, yet it is unknown whether the functional impact of CAD also impacts outcomes in this cohort. DILEMMA score (DS) is a validated angiographic functional scoring tool that correlates with fractional flow reserve and instantaneous wave-free ratio. This study sought to assess the functional impact of CAD on outcomes in patients undergoing TAVR for severe aortic stenosis (AS). METHODS/MATERIALS: 229 patients were included in this analysis. Patients underwent angiographic DS and SS and were classified using predefined values. The primary endpoint was one-year all-cause mortality, with secondary endpoints of 30-day major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE). RESULTS: The mean age was 83.9 +/- 0.5 years (55.0% female), with 11.8% all-cause mortality. CAD defined by >/=30% stenosis in any vessel was not associated with adverse outcomes (HR = 1.08, p = 0.84). However, the risk of one-year mortality was greater in patients with either SS > 9 (20.8% vs. 9.4%, HR 2.34, p = 0.03) or DS > 2 (18.4% vs. 8.5%, HR = 2.28, p = 0.03). Both scoring systems were also associated with 30-day MACCE (both p < 0.05). After multivariate adjustment, independent predictors of one-year mortality were DS > 2 (HR = 2.29, p = 0.04), left ventricular ejection fraction <50% (HR 2.66, p = 0.04) and COPD (HR 2.43, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that angiographic functional scoring is independently predictive of both 12-month mortality and 30-day MACCE following TAVR.},

   abstract = {Characterizing genetic influences on DNA methylation (DNAm) provides an opportunity to understand mechanisms underpinning gene regulation and disease. In the present study, we describe results of DNAm quantitative trait locus (mQTL) analyses on 32,851 participants, identifying genetic variants associated with DNAm at 420,509 DNAm sites in blood. We present a database of >270,000 independent mQTLs, of which 8.5% comprise long-range (trans) associations. Identified mQTL associations explain 15-17% of the additive genetic variance of DNAm. We show that the genetic architecture of DNAm levels is highly polygenic. Using shared genetic control between distal DNAm sites, we constructed networks, identifying 405 discrete genomic communities enriched for genomic annotations and complex traits. Shared genetic variants are associated with both DNAm levels and complex diseases, but only in a minority of cases do these associations reflect causal relationships from DNAm to trait or vice versa, indicating a more complex genotype-phenotype map than previously anticipated.},

Our motivating application is the Southall And Brent REvisited (SABRE) study, a tri-ethnic cohort study conducted in the UK. We are interested in identifying potential ethnic differences in metabolite levels and associations as well as their evolution over time, with the aim of gaining a better understanding of different risk of cardio-metabolic disorders across ethnicities. Within a Bayesian framework, we employ a nodewise regression approach to infer the structure of the graphs, borrowing information across time as well as across ethnicities. The response variables of interest are metabolite levels measured at two time points and for two ethnic groups, Europeans and South-Asians. We use nodewise regression to estimate the high-dimensional precision matrices of the metabolites, imposing sparsity on the regression coefficients through the dynamic horseshoe prior, thus favouring sparser graphs. We provide the code to fit the proposed model using the software Stan, which performs posterior inference using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, as well as a detailed description of a block Gibbs sampling scheme.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) in mitral regurgitation (MR) is difficult to quantify. Clinically it is measured using the proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) method, which is intrinsically not automatable, because it requires the operator to manually identify the mitral valve orifice. We introduce a new fully automated algorithm, ("AQURO"), which calculates EROA directly from echocardiographic colour M-mode data, without requiring operator input. METHODS: Multiple PISA measurements were compared to multiple AQURO measurements in twenty patients with MR. For PISA analysis, three mutually blinded observers measured EROA from the four stored video loops. For AQURO analysis, the software automatically processed the colour M-mode datasets and analysed the velocity field in the flow-convergence zone to extract EROA directly without any requirement for manual radius measurement. RESULTS: Reproducibility, measured by intraclass correlation (ICC), for PISA was 0.80, 0.83 and 0.83 (for 3 observers respectively). Reproducibility for AQURO was 0.97. Agreement between replicate measurements calculated using Bland-Altman standard deviation of difference (SDD) was 21,17 and 17mm(2)for the three respective observers viewing independent video loops using PISA. Agreement between replicate measurements for AQURO was 6, 5 and 7mm(2)for automated analysis of the three pairs of datasets. CONCLUSIONS: By eliminating the need to identify the orifice location, AQURO avoids an important source of measurement variability. Compared with PISA, it also reduces the analysis time allowing analysis and averaging of data from significantly more beats, improving the consistency of EROA quantification. AQURO, being fully automated, is a simple, effective enhancement for EROA quantification using standard echocardiographic equipment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Guidelines for quantifying mitral regurgitation (MR) using "proximal isovelocity surface area" (PISA) instruct operators to measure the PISA radius from valve orifice to Doppler flow convergence "hemisphere". Using clinical data and a physically-constructed MR model we (A) analyse the actually-observed colour Doppler PISA shape and (B) test whether instructions to measure a "hemisphere" are helpful. METHODS AND RESULTS: In part A, the true shape of PISA shells was investigated using three separate approaches. First, a systematic review of published examples consistently showed non-hemispherical, "urchinoid" shapes. Second, our clinical data confirmed that the Doppler-visualized surface is non-hemispherical. Third, in-vitro experiments showed that round orifices never produce a colour Doppler hemisphere. In part B, six observers were instructed to measure hemisphere radius rh and (on a second viewing) urchinoid distance (du) in 11 clinical PISA datasets; 6 established experts also measured PISA distance as the gold standard. rh measurements, generated using the hemisphere instruction significantly underestimated expert values (-28%, p<0.0005), meaning r(h)(2) was underestimated by approximately 2-fold. du measurements, generated using the non-hemisphere instruction were less biased (+7%, p=0.03). Finally, frame-to-frame variability in PISA distance was found to have a coefficient of variation (CV) of 25% in patients and 9% in in-vitro data. Beat-to-beat variability had a CV of 15% in patients. CONCLUSIONS: Doppler-visualized PISA shells are not hemispherical: we should avoid advising observers to measure a hemispherical radius because it encourages underestimation of orifice area by approximately two-fold. If precision is needed (e.g. to detect changes reliably) multi-frame averaging is essential.},

Lovastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, has been shown to reduce myointimal hyperplasia in animal models of restenosis and in one clinical coronary restenosis trial. We have assessed the effect of lovastatin on the growth of cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells derived from saphenous vein and vascular graft stenoses. Lovastatin (2 microM) inhibited proliferation over 14 days in saphenous vein (and graft stenoses) derived vascular smooth muscle cells by 42% and 32% respectively: this was not significantly different. Lovastatin (10 microM) reduced [methyl 3H]-thymidine uptake by 51% in saphenous vein-derived cells. These concentrations were significantly higher than those achieved in plasma during therapeutic dosage. Lovastatin-induced inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and [methyl 3H]-thymidine uptake was completely reversed by adding mevalonate (100 microM) but cholesterol (10-40 micrograms ml-1) had no effect. Isopentenyl adenine (25-50 microM) did not affect the inhibition of [methyl 3H]-thymidine uptake by lovastatin (10 microM), but farnesol (20 microM), another isoprenoid precursor of cholesterol synthesis, reversed the antiproliferative effect.},

   abstract = {Background/ObjectivesThere is growing evidence that early development of obesity increases cardiovascular risk later in life, but less is known about whether there are effects of long-term excess body weight on the biological drivers associated with the atherosclerotic pathway, particularly adipokines, inflammatory and endothelial markers. This paper therefore investigates the influence of overweight across the life course on levels of these markers at retirement age.Subjects/MethodsData from the MRC National Survey of Health and Development (n=1784) were used to examine associations between overweight status at 2, 4, 6, 7, 11, 15, 20, 26, 36, 43, 53 and 60-64 years (BMI25 kg/m2 for adult ages and gender-specific cut-points for childhood ages equivalent to BMI25 kg/m2) and measurements of adipokines (leptin, adiponectin), inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP], Interleukin-6 [IL-6]) and endothelial markers (E-selectin, tissue plasminogen activator [t-PA] and von Willebrand factor) at 60-64 years. Additionally, the fit of different life course models (sensitive periods/accumulation) was compared using partial F-tests.ResultsIn age and sex-adjusted models, overweight at 11 years and onwards was associated with higher leptin, CRP and IL-6 and lower adiponectin; overweight at 15 years and onwards with higher E-selectin and t-PA. Associations between overweight at all ages earlier than 60-64 with leptin, adiponectin, CRP and IL-6 were reduced but remained apparent after adjustment for overweight at 60-64 years; while those with E-selectin and t-PA were entirely explained. An accumulation model best described the associations between overweight across the life course with adipokines and inflammatory markers, while for the endothelial markers the sensitive period model for 60-64 years provided a slightly better fit than the accumulation model.ConclusionsOverweight across the life course has a cumulative influence on adipokines, inflammatory and possibly endothelial markers. Avoidance of overweight from adolescence onwards is likely important for cardiovascular disease prevention.International Journal of Obesity accepted article preview online, 13 February 2015. doi:10.1038/ijo.2015.19.},

   abstract = {Although it is recognized that risks of cardiovascular diseases associated with heart failure develop over the life course, no studies have reported whether life course socioeconomic inequalities exist for heart failure risk. The Medical Research Council's National Survey of Health and Development was used to investigate associations between occupational socioeconomic position during childhood, early adulthood and middle age and measures of cardiac structure [left ventricular (LV) mass index and relative wall thickness (RWT)] and function [systolic: ejection fraction (EF) and midwall fractional shortening (mFS); diastolic: left atrial (LA) volume, E/A ratio and E/e' ratio)]. Different life course models were compared with a saturated model to ascertain the nature of the relationship between socioeconomic position across the life course and each cardiac marker. Findings showed that models where socioeconomic position accumulated over multiple time points in life provided the best fit for 3 of the 7 cardiac markers: childhood and early adulthood periods for the E/A ratio and E/e' ratio, and all three life periods for LV mass index. These associations were attenuated by adjustment for adiposity, but were little affected by adjustment for other established or novel cardio-metabolic risk factors. There was no evidence of a relationship between socioeconomic position at any time point and RWT, EF, mFS or LA volume index. In conclusion, socioeconomic position across multiple points of the lifecourse, particularly earlier in life, is an important determinant of some measures of LV structure and function. BMI may be an important mediator of these associations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although age is the biggest known risk factor for dementia, there remains uncertainty about other factors over the life course that contribute to a person's risk for cognitive decline later in life. Furthermore, the pathological processes leading to dementia are not fully understood. The main goals of Insight 46-a multi-phase longitudinal observational study-are to collect detailed cognitive, neurological, physical, cardiovascular, and sensory data; to combine those data with genetic and life-course information collected from the MRC National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD; 1946 British birth cohort); and thereby contribute to a better understanding of healthy ageing and dementia. METHODS/DESIGN: Phase 1 of Insight 46 (2015-2018) involved the recruitment of 502 members of the NSHD (median age = 70.7 years; 49% female) and has been described in detail by Lane and Parker et al. 2017. The present paper describes phase 2 (2018-2021) and phase 3 (2021-ongoing). Of the 502 phase 1 study members who were invited to a phase 2 research visit, 413 were willing to return for a clinic visit in London and 29 participated in a remote research assessment due to COVID-19 restrictions. Phase 3 aims to recruit 250 study members who previously participated in both phases 1 and 2 of Insight 46 (providing a third data time point) and 500 additional members of the NSHD who have not previously participated in Insight 46. DISCUSSION: The NSHD is the oldest and longest continuously running British birth cohort. Members of the NSHD are now at a critical point in their lives for us to investigate successful ageing and key age-related brain morbidities. Data collected from Insight 46 have the potential to greatly contribute to and impact the field of healthy ageing and dementia by combining unique life course data with longitudinal multiparametric clinical, imaging, and biomarker measurements. Further protocol enhancements are planned, including in-home sleep measurements and the engagement of participants through remote online cognitive testing. Data collected are and will continue to be made available to the scientific community.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite clear associations with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, the mechanisms driving aortic pressure propagation remain incompletely defined. The reservoir-wave approach has been proposed as a representative model of central aortic pressure generation however its application at differing aortic locations has not been investigated. DESIGN AND METHOD: We analysed invasively acquired aortic pressure waveforms from 40 patients undergoing clinically indicated catheterisation. Waveforms were acquired at the level of the ascending aorta, transverse aortic arch, diaphragm, renal arteries and aortic bifurcation using a solid-state transducer. Reservoir-wave analysis was performed according to previously described techniques to determine reservoir and excess pressures and systolic and diastolic rate constants (ks and kd). ks is inversely related to the product of aortic characteristic impedance and total arterial compliance while kd is inversely related to the product of systemic arterial resistance and arterial compliance and is the reciprocal of the diastolic time constant. Repeated measures 1-way-ANOVA with Dunnett's test for multiple comparisons was used to compare parameters at the 5 aortic sites. RESULTS: Systolic blood pressure increased predictably from the ascending aorta to the bifurcation, whilst diastolic blood pressure remained constant. ks (corresponding to characteristic impedance) increased while kd decreased with distal progression. The excess pressure integral increased with distal progression (P < 0.001) whereas the reservoir pressure integral decreased and maximal reservoir pressure did not vary. The timing of peak reservoir pressure (relative to the initial systolic upstroke) decreased progressively from the aortic root (P < 0.001) whilst the timing of maximal excess pressure did not change.(Figure is included in full-text article.) CONCLUSIONS: : The increase in maximum excess pressure (probably wave related) between the ascending aorta and bifurcation and the constant time to peak excess pressure suggests that wave transmission is relatively more important in determining distal conduit arterial pressures. The decrease in ks with distal progression is consistent with gradually rising impedance whilst the increase in kd is suggestive of progressively decreasingly compliance. These findings support previous data suggesting a relatively minor role for wave reflection in determining the amplitude of the aortic pressure waveform.},

   abstract = {Several morphological parameters based on the central aortic pressure waveform are proposed as cardiovascular risk markers, yet no study has definitively demonstrated the incremental value of any waveform parameter in addition to currently accepted biomarkers in elderly, hypertensive patients. The reservoir-wave concept combines elements of wave transmission and Windkessel models of arterial pressure generation, defining an excess pressure superimposed on a background reservoir pressure. The utility of pressure rate constants derived from reservoir-wave analysis in prediction of cardiovascular events is unknown. Carotid blood pressure waveforms were measured prerandomization in a subset of 838 patients in the Second Australian National Blood Pressure Study. Reservoir-wave analysis was performed and indices of arterial function, including the systolic and diastolic rate constants, were derived. Survival analysis was performed to determine the association between reservoir-wave parameters and cardiovascular events. The incremental utility of reservoir-wave parameters in addition to the Framingham Risk Score was assessed. Baseline values of the systolic rate constant were independently predictive of clinical outcome (hazard ratio, 0.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.82; P=0.016 for fatal and nonfatal stroke and myocardial infarction and hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.74; P=0.004 for the composite end point, including all cardiovascular events). Addition of this parameter to the Framingham Risk Score was associated with an improvement in predictive accuracy for cardiovascular events as assessed by the integrated discrimination improvement and net reclassification improvement indices. This analysis demonstrates that baseline values of the systolic rate constant predict clinical outcomes in elderly patients with hypertension and incrementally improve prognostication of cardiovascular events.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The development and propagation of the aortic blood pressure wave remains poorly understood, despite its clear relevance to major organ blood flow and potential association with cardiovascular outcomes. The reservoir pressure model provides a unified description of the dual conduit and reservoir functions of the aorta. Reservoir waveform analysis resolves the aortic pressure waveform into an excess (wave related) and reservoir (compliance related) pressure. The applicability of this model to the pressure waveform as it propagates along the aorta has not been investigated in humans. METHODS: We analysed invasively acquired high-fidelity aortic pressure waveforms from 40 patients undergoing clinically indicated coronary catheterization. Aortic waveforms were measured using a solid-state pressure catheter at five anatomical sites: the ascending aorta, the transverse aortic arch, the diaphragm, the level of the renal arteries, and at the aortic bifurcation. Ensemble average pressure waveforms were obtained for these sites for each patient and analysed to obtain the reservoir pressure [Pr(t)] and the excess pressure [Px(t)] at each aortic position. RESULTS: Systolic blood pressure increased at a rate of 2.1 mmHg per site along the aorta, whereas diastolic blood pressure was effectively constant. Maximum Pr decreased only slightly along the aorta (changing by -0.7 mmHg per site), whereas the maximum of Px increased from the proximal to distal aorta (+4.1 mmHg per site; P < 0.001). The time, relative to the start of systolic upstroke, of the occurrence of the maximum excess pressure did not vary along the aorta. Of the parameters used to derive the reservoir pressure waveform the systolic and diastolic rate constants showed divergent changes with the systolic rate constant (ks) decreasing and the diastolic rate constant (kd) increasing along the aorta. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis confirms the proposition that the magnitude of the calculated reservoir pressure waveform, despite known changes in aortic structure, is effectively constant throughout the aorta. A progressive increase of excess pressure accounts for the increase in pulse pressure from the proximal to distal aorta. The reservoir pressure rate constants seem to behave as arterial functional parameters. The accompanying decrease in ks and increase in kd are consistent with a progressive decrease in aortic compliance and increase in impedance. The reservoir pressure waveform therefore provides a model that might have utility in understanding the generation of central blood pressure and in specific cases might have clinical utility.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is an indicator of arterial stiffness, and predicts cardiovascular events independently of blood pressure. Currently, PWV is commonly measured by the foot-to-foot technique thus giving a global estimate of large arterial stiffness. However, and despite its importance, methods to measure the stiffness of the ascending aorta are limited. OBJECTIVE: To introduce a method for calculating local PWV in the human ascending aorta using non-invasive ultrasound measurements of its diameter (D) and flow velocity (U). APPROACH: Ten participants (four females) were recruited from Brunel University students. Ascending aortic diameter and velocity were recorded with a GE Vivid E95 equipped with a 1.5-4.5 MHz phased array transducer using M-mode in the parasternal long axis view and pulse wave Doppler in the apical five chamber view respectively. Groups of six consecutive heartbeats were selected from each 20 s run based on the most similar cycle length resulting in three groups for D and three for U each with six waveforms. Each D waveform was paired with each U waveform to calculate PWV using ln(D)U-loop method. MAIN RESULTS: The diastolic portions of the diameters or velocities waveforms were truncated to allow the pairs to have equal length and were used to construct ln(D)U-loops. The trimmed average, excluding 10% of extreme values, resulting from the 324 loops was considered representative for each participant. Overall mean local PWV for all participants was 4.1(SD = 0.9) m s(-1). SIGNIFICANCE: Local PWV can be measured non-invasively in the ascending aorta using ultrasound measurements of diameter and flow velocity This should facilitate more widespread assessment of ascending aortic stiffness in larger studies.},

Wave intensity and wave speed measured in the carotid artery have the potential to provide hemodynamic and biophysical insights that can advance our understanding of the physiology of cerebral circulation. However, whilst studies have been performed in different patient cohorts exploring different methodological implementations of wave intensity analysis (WIA), to date little work has been done to unify wave measures or provide reference ranges on which to build the field of research and inform clinical practice. This review thus focuses on wave speed and wave intensity in the carotid artery in man with the aim to summarise the current knowledge of the field. From this review, the different methods of measurement and the disparity of the reported values currently hinder efforts to construct reference ranges for a comparator or intervention to be assessed.},

In vitro studies have been performed on human medium-sized muscular arteries (internal diameter 1-4 mm) in a classical organ bath and with human subcutaneous resistance arteries (internal diameter 103-626 microns) in a microvascular myograph. 2. Although the medium-sized muscular arteries showed no response to either of the alpha 2-agonists B-HT 933 or UK 14304 in concentrations up to 10 microM, the subcutaneous resistance arteries from all regions examined showed well-pronounced and concentration-dependent responses to B-HT 933, the pD2 (-log EC50) being 5.11 +/- 0.09. 3. In the resistance arteries the alpha 2-antagonist yohimbine caused a parallel shift to the right of the B-HT 933 concentration-response curve; the yohimbine pA2 for the B-HT 933 receptor was 7.86 +/- 0.12. 4. There was an inverse relationship between the maximum response to B-HT 933 and the calibre of the resistance vessels. 5. These results indicate the presence of a postjunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptor in human subcutaneous resistance arteries and not in medium sized muscular arteries.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought a method for any reader to quantify the limit, imposed by variability, to sustainably observable R(2) between any baseline predictor and response marker. We then apply this to echocardiographic measurements of mechanical dyssynchrony and response. BACKGROUND: Can mechanical dyssynchrony markers strongly predict ventricular remodeling by biventricular pacing (cardiac resynchronization therapy)? METHODS: First, we established the mathematical depression of observable R(2) arising from: 1) spontaneous variability of response markers; and 2) test-retest variability of dyssynchrony measurements. Second, we contrasted published R(2) values between externally monitored randomized controlled trials and highly skilled single-center studies (HSSCSs). RESULTS: Inherent variability of response markers causes a contraction factor in R(2) of 0.48 (change in left ventricular ejection fraction [DeltaLVEF]), 0.50 (change in end-systolic volume [DeltaESV]), and 0.40 (change in end-diastolic volume [DeltaEDV]). Simultaneously, inherent variability of mechanical dyssynchrony markers causes a contraction factor of between 0.16 and 0.92 (average, 0.6). Therefore the combined contraction factor, that is, limit on sustainably observable R(2) between mechanical dyssynchrony markers and response, is ~0.29 (DeltaLVEF), ~0.24 (DeltaESV), and ~0.30 (DeltaEDV). Many R(2) values published in HSSCSs exceeded these mathematical limits; none in externally monitored trials did so. Overall, HSSCSs overestimate R(2) by 5- to 20-fold (p = 0.002). Absence of bias-resistance features in study design (formal enrollment and blinded measurements) was associated with more overstatement of R(2). CONCLUSIONS: Reports of R(2) > 0.2 in response prediction arose exclusively from studies without formally documented enrollment and blinding. The HSSCS approach overestimates R(2) values, frequently breaching the mathematical ceiling on sustainably observable R(2), which is far below 1.0, and can easily be calculated by readers using formulas presented here. Community awareness of this low ceiling may help resist future claims. Reliable individualized response prediction, using methods originally designed for group-mean effects, may never be possible because it has 2 currently unavailable and perhaps impossible prerequisites: 1) excellent blinded test-retest reproducibility of dyssynchrony; and 2) response markers reproducible over time within nonintervened individuals. Dispassionate evaluation, and improvement, of test-retest reproducibility is required before any further claims of strong prediction. Prediction studies should be designed to resist bias.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) aims to increase coronary blood flow by relieving epicardial obstruction. However, no study has objectively confirmed this and assessed changes in flow over different phases of the cardiac cycle. We quantified the change in resting and hyperemic flow velocity after PCI in stenoses defined physiologically by fractional flow reserve and other parameters. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy-five stenoses (67 patients) underwent paired flow velocity assessment before and after PCI. Flow velocity was measured over the whole cardiac cycle and the wave-free period. Mean fractional flow reserve was 0.68+/-0.02. Pre-PCI, hyperemic flow velocity is diminished in stenoses classed as physiologically significant compared with those classed nonsignificant (P<0.001). In significant stenoses, flow velocity over the resting wave-free period and hyperemic flow velocity did not differ statistically. After PCI, resting flow velocity over the wave-free period increased little (5.6+/-1.6 cm/s) and significantly less than hyperemic flow velocity (21.2+/-3 cm/s; P<0.01). The greatest increase in hyperemic flow velocity was observed when treating stenoses below physiological cut points; treating stenoses with fractional flow reserve </=0.80 gained Delta28.5+/-3.8 cm/s, whereas those fractional flow reserve >0.80 had a significantly smaller gain (Delta4.6+/-2.3 cm/s; P<0.001). The change in pressure-only physiological indices demonstrated a curvilinear relationship to the change in hyperemic flow velocity but was flat for resting flow velocity. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-PCI physiology is strongly associated with post-PCI increase in hyperemic coronary flow velocity. Hyperemic flow velocity increases 6-fold more when stenoses classed as physiologically significant undergo PCI than when nonsignificant stenoses are treated. Resting flow velocity measured over the wave-free period changes at least 4-fold less than hyperemic flow velocity after PCI.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to perform hemodynamic mapping of the entire vessel using motorized pullback of a pressure guidewire with continuous instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) measurement. BACKGROUND: Serial stenoses or diffuse vessel narrowing hamper pressure wire-guided management of coronary stenoses. Characterization of functional relevance of individual stenoses or narrowed segments constitutes an unmet need in ischemia-driven percutaneous revascularization. METHODS: The study was performed in 32 coronary arteries with tandem and/or diffusely diseased vessels. An automated iFR physiological map, integrating pullback speed and physiological information, was built using dedicated software to calculate physiological stenosis severity, length, and intensity (DeltaiFR/mm). This map was used to predict the best-case post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) iFR (iFRexp) according to the stented location, and this was compared with the observed iFR post-PCI (iFRobs). RESULTS: After successful PCI, the mean difference between iFRexp and iFRobs was small (mean difference: 0.016 +/- 0.004) with a strong relationship between DeltaiFRexp and DeltaiFRobs (r = 0.97, p < 0.001). By identifying differing iFR intensities, it was possible to identify functional stenosis length and quantify the contribution of each individual stenosis or narrowed segment to overall vessel stenotic burden. Physiological lesion length was shorter than anatomic length (12.6 +/- 1.5 vs. 23.3 +/- 1.3, p < 0.001), and targeting regions with the highest iFR intensity predicted significant improvement post-PCI (r = 0.86, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: iFR measurements during continuous resting pressure wire pullback provide a physiological map of the entire coronary vessel. Before a PCI, the iFR pullback can predict the hemodynamic consequences of stenting specific stenoses and thereby may facilitate the intervention and stenting strategy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) can detect improvement in stenosis significance after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and compare this with fractional flow reserve (FFR) and whole cycle Pd/Pa. DESIGN: A prospective observational study was undertaken in elective patients scheduled for PCI with FFR </= 0.80. Intracoronary pressures were measured at rest and during adenosine-mediated vasodilatation, before and after PCI. iFR, Pd/Pa and FFR values were calculated using the validated fully automated algorithms. SETTING: Coronary catheter laboratories in two UK centres and one in the USA. PATIENTS: 120 coronary stenoses in 112 patients were assessed. The mean age was 63 +/- 10 years, while 84% were male; 39% smokers; 33% with diabetes. Mean diameter stenosis was 68 +/- 16% by quantitative coronary angiography. RESULTS: Pre-PCI, mean FFR was 0.66 +/- 0.14, mean iFR was 0.75 +/- 0.21 and mean Pd/Pa 0.83 +/- 0.16. PCI increased all indices significantly (FFR 0.89 +/- 0.07, p<0.001; iFR 0.94 +/- 0.05, p<0.001; Pd/Pa 0.96 +/- 0.04, p<0.001). The change in iFR after intervention (0.20 +/- 0.21) was similar to DeltaFFR 0.22 +/- 0.15 (p=0.25). DeltaFFR and DeltaiFR were significantly larger than resting DeltaPd/Pa (0.13 +/- 0.16, both p<0.001). Similar incremental changes occurred in patients with a higher prevalence of risk factors for microcirculatory disease such as diabetes and hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: iFR and FFR detect the changes in coronary haemodynamics elicited by PCI. FFR and iFR have a significantly larger dynamic range than resting Pd/Pa. iFR might be used to objectively document improvement in coronary haemodynamics following PCI in a similar manner to FFR.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Resting heart rate (RHR) is an independent risk factor for mortality. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether elevations in childhood and mid-adulthood RHR, including changes over time, are associated with mortality later in life. We sought to evaluate the association between RHR across the life course, along with its changes and all-cause mortality. METHODS: We studied 4638 men and women from the Medical Research Council (MRC) National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) cohort born during 1 week in 1946. RHR was obtained during childhood at ages 6, 7 and 11, and in mid-adulthood at ages 36 and 43. Using multivariable Cox regression, we calculated the HR for incident mortality according to RHR measured at each time point, along with changes in mid-adulthood RHR. RESULTS: At age 11, those in the top fifth of the RHR distribution (>/=97 bpm) had an increased adjusted hazard of 1.42 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.93) for all-cause mortality. A higher adjusted risk (HR, 95% CI 2.17, 1.40 to 3.36) of death was also observed for those in the highest fifth (>/=81 bpm) at age 43. For a >25 bpm increased change in the RHR over the course of 7 years (age 36-43), the adjusted hazard was elevated more than threefold (HR, 95% CI 3.26, 1.54 to 6.90). After adjustment, RHR at ages 6, 7 and 36 were not associated with all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated RHR during childhood and midlife, along with greater changes in mid-adulthood RHR, are associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Males have greater cardiometabolic risk than females, though the reasons for this are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to examine the association between common Y chromosomal haplogroups and cardiometabolic risk during early life. METHODS: In a British birth cohort, we examined the association of Y chromosomal haplogroups with trajectories of cardiometabolic risk factors from birth to 18 years and with carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, carotid intima media thickness and left ventricular mass index at age 18. Haplogroups were grouped according to their phylogenetic relatedness into categories of R, I, E, J, G and all other haplogroups combined (T, Q, H, L, C, N and O). Risk factors included BMI, fat and lean mass, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), non-HDL-c and c-reactive protein. Analyses were performed using multilevel models and linear regression, as appropriate. RESULTS: Y chromosomal haplogroups were not associated with any cardiometabolic risk factors from birth to 18 years. For example, at age 18, the difference in SBP comparing each haplogroup with haplogroup R was -0.39mmHg (95% Confidence Interval (CI): -0.75, 1.54) for haplogroup I, 2.56mmHg (95% CI: -0.76, 5.89) for haplogroup E, -0.02mmHg (95% CI: -2.87, 2.83) for haplogroup J, 1.28mmHg (95% CI: -4.70, 2.13) for haplogroup G and -2.75mmHg (95% CI: -6.38, 0.88) for all other haplogroups combined. CONCLUSIONS: Common Y chromosomal haplogroups are not associated with cardiometabolic risk factors during childhood and adolescence or with subclinical cardiovascular measures at age 18.},

   abstract = {Children with obesity typically have larger left ventricular heart dimensions during adulthood. However, whether this is due to a persistent effect of adiposity extending into adulthood is challenging to disentangle due to confounding factors throughout the lifecourse. We conducted a multivariable mendelian randomization (MR) study to separate the independent effects of childhood and adult body size on 4 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of heart structure and function in the UK Biobank (UKB) study. Strong evidence of a genetically predicted effect of childhood body size on all measures of adulthood heart structure was identified, which remained robust upon accounting for adult body size using a multivariable MR framework (e.g., left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), Beta = 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23 to 0.43, P = 4.6 x 10-10). Sensitivity analyses did not suggest that other lifecourse measures of body composition were responsible for these effects. Conversely, evidence of a genetically predicted effect of childhood body size on various other MRI-based measures, such as fat percentage in the liver (Beta = 0.14, 95% CI = 0.05 to 0.23, P = 0.002) and pancreas (Beta = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.33, P = 3.9 x 10-4), attenuated upon accounting for adult body size. Our findings suggest that childhood body size has a long-term (and potentially immutable) influence on heart structure in later life. In contrast, effects of childhood body size on other measures of adulthood organ size and fat percentage evaluated in this study are likely explained by the long-term consequence of remaining overweight throughout the lifecourse.},

   abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) is a cardiac autonomic marker with predictive value in cardiac patients. Ultra-short HRV (usHRV) can be measured at scale using standard and wearable ECGs, but its association with cardiovascular events in the general population is undetermined. We aimed to validate usHRV measured using </= 15-s ECGs (using RMSSD, SDSD and PHF indices) and investigate its association with atrial fibrillation, major adverse cardiac events, stroke and mortality in individuals without cardiovascular disease. In the National Survey for Health and Development (n = 1337 participants), agreement between 15-s and 6-min HRV, assessed with correlation analysis and Bland-Altman plots, was very good for RMSSD and SDSD and good for PHF. In the UK Biobank (n = 51,628 participants, 64% male, median age 58), after a median follow-up of 11.5 (11.4-11.7) years, incidence of outcomes ranged between 1.7% and 4.3%. Non-linear Cox regression analysis showed that reduced usHRV from 15-, 10- and 5-s ECGs was associated with all outcomes. Individuals with low usHRV (< 20th percentile) had hazard ratios for outcomes between 1.16 and 1.29, p < 0.05, with respect to the reference group. In conclusion, usHRV from </= 15-s ECGs correlates with standard short-term HRV and predicts increased risk of cardiovascular events in a large population-representative cohort.},

   abstract = {Impact of variability in the measured parameter is rarely considered in designing clinical protocols for optimization of atrioventricular (AV) or interventricular (VV) delay of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). In this article, we approach this question quantitatively using mathematical simulation in which the true optimum is known and examine practical implications using some real measurements. We calculated the performance of any optimization process that selects the pacing setting which maximizes an underlying signal, such as flow or pressure, in the presence of overlying random variability (noise). If signal and noise are of equal size, for a 5-choice optimization (60, 100, 140, 180, 220 ms), replicate AV delay optima are rarely identical but rather scattered with a standard deviation of 45 ms. This scatter was overwhelmingly determined (rho = -0.975, P < 0.001) by Information Content, [Formula: see text], an expression of signal-to-noise ratio. Averaging multiple replicates improves information content. In real clinical data, at resting, heart rate information content is often only 0.2-0.3; elevated pacing rates can raise information content above 0.5. Low information content (e.g. <0.5) causes gross overestimation of optimization-induced increment in VTI, high false-positive appearance of change in optimum between visits and very wide confidence intervals of individual patient optimum. AV and VV optimization by selecting the setting showing maximum cardiac function can only be accurate if information content is high. Simple steps to reduce noise such as averaging multiple replicates, or to increase signal such as increasing heart rate, can improve information content, and therefore viability, of any optimization process.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between left ventricular (LV) long and short axes, aortic pressure (P), flow velocity (U) and wave intensity is not well established. METHODS: Eleven dogs were anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated and LV long and minor axes shortening velocities were calculated using ultrasound crystals. P and U were measured in the ascending aorta using a high fidelity pressure catheter and ultrasonic flow transducer. RESULTS: Pre-ejection: The LV minor axis began to shorten as the long axis lengthened creating LV shape change. Early ejection: The aortic valve opened 83+/-20 ms after the ECG Q-wave. Aortic P and U simultaneously increased; peak aortic velocity and maximum minor axis shortening velocity (M(max)) occurred at 152+24 and 147+24 ms, respectively; p=0.66, intra-class correlation ICC 0.93). M(max) also corresponded to the time when the reflected compression wave arrived back to the heart (ICC 0.75). Late ejection: LV long axis reached its peak shortening velocity 28+21 ms later than the minor axis at 175+/-33 ms, coinciding with peak LV pressure (187+25 ms; p=0.77, ICC 0.65) and onset of the forward expansion wave (177+28 ms, p=0.88, ICC 0.89). Both axes then continued to slow until 210+/-30 ms when an increased rate of decline of shortening velocity corresponded with peak aortic pressure. CONCLUSION: Long axis peak shortening velocity lagged consistently behind the minor axis, representing a degree of normal asynchrony. The arrival of the reflected wave appears to bring about the slowing down of the minor axis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The arterial pressure waveform reflects the interaction between the heart and the arterial system and carries potentially relevant information about circulatory status. According to the commonly accepted 'wave transmission model', the net BP waveform results from the super-position of discrete forward and backward pressure waves, with the forward wave in systole determined mainly by the left ventricular (LV) ejection function and the backward by the wave reflection from the periphery, the timing and amplitude of which depend on arterial stiffness, the wave propagation speed and the extent of downstream admittance mismatching. However, this approach obscures the 'Windkessel function' of the elastic arteries. Recently, a 'reservoir-excess pressure' model has been proposed, which interprets the arterial BP waveform as a composite of a volume-related 'reservoir' pressure and a wave-related 'excess' pressure. METHODS: In this study we applied the reservoir-excess pressure approach to the analysis of carotid arterial pressure waveforms (applanation tonometry) in 10 young healthy volunteers before and after a 5-week head down tilt bed rest which induced a significant reduction in stroke volume (SV), end-diastolic LV volume and LV longitudinal function without significant changes in central blood pressure, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance and aortic stiffness. Forward and backward pressure components were also determined by wave separation analysis. RESULTS: Compared to the baseline state, bed rest induced a significant reduction in LV ejection time (LVET), diastolic time (DT), backward pressure amplitude (bP) and pressure reservoir integral (INTPR). INTPR correlated directly with LVET, DT, time to the peak of backward wave (bT) and stroke volume, while excess pressure integral (INTXSP) correlated directly with central pressure. Furthermore, Delta.INTPR correlated directly with Delta.LVET, and Delta.DT, and in multivariate analysis INTPR was independently related to LVET and DT and INTXSP to central systolic BP. CONCLUSION: This is an hypothesis generating paper which adds support to the idea that the reservoir-wave hypothesis applied to non-invasively obtained carotid pressure waveforms is of potential clinical usefulness.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: People of Indian Asian descent have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) that cannot be explained by diabetes and other established CVD risk factors. We investigated if microcirculatory function was impaired in a population-based sample of people of Indian Asian descent compared with Europeans in the UK and whether any differences could be accounted for by diabetes or other CVD risk factors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Cutaneous microvascular function was assessed using laser Doppler fluximetry in response to heating to 42 degrees C (maximum hyperaemia) and 3 min arterial occlusion (post occlusive reactive hyperaemia: PORH) in 148 Indian Asians and 147 Europeans. Blood pressure, anthropometry and fasting bloods were also measured. RESULTS: Maximum hyperaemia and minimum resistance did not differ significantly by ethnicity. Resting flux and PORH were lower in Indian Asians and time to peak of PORH was prolonged. Diabetes was associated with reduced maximum hyperaemia and PORH. Adjustment for diabetes accounted for differences in resting flux and time to peak but not differences in PORH (Europeans = 45.0 (40.3, 50.1)au, Indian Asians = 35.6 (31.9, 39.7)au, mean (95% confidence interval); p = 0.008 after adjustment). Differences in conventional CVD risk factors did not account for interethnic differences in microvascular responses. CONCLUSIONS: People of Indian Asian descent have impaired post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia unexplained by diabetes, dysglycaemia or other CVD risk factors. Abnormal microvascular function in response to ischaemia could represent a novel mechanism contributing to the elevated risk of CVD in Indian Asians.},

   abstract = {Unlike in older people, it has been suggested that elevated blood pressure (BP) in young people is because of high cardiac output accompanied by normal total peripheral resistance (TPR)-a hyperkinetic/hyperdynamic circulation. We investigated this in a large, United Kingdom-based birth cohort of adolescents. The study was conducted on 2091 17-year-old participants in the ALSPAC (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children)-a prospective population-based birth cohort study. BP measurement and echocardiography were performed, and heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), and TPR were calculated. Data are means (SD). Higher quintiles of systolic BP were associated with higher SV, higher HR, and higher TPR. The proportional contribution made by SV, HR, and TPR to mean arterial pressure differed little by systolic BP quintile (SV [32%-34%], HR [25%-29%], and TPR [39%-41%]). Higher BP is attributable to a combination of higher cardiac output (ie, SVxHR) and higher TPR in a population-based sample of adolescents. There is no evidence of a disproportionate contribution from elevated cardiac output at higher BP levels.},

   abstract = {Increased wave reflection is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events, possibly due to effects on left ventricular (LV) function. We investigated the relationship between reflected waves in early systole, the forward decompression wave in mid-late systole and LV mechanical behavior. Invasively acquired ascending aortic velocity, pressure, and LV long and minor axes' dimensions were measured simultaneously in 11 anesthetized dogs during both control conditions and aortic occlusion to cause additional early wave reflection. Wave intensity analysis (WIA) was used to identify the arrival of the reflected wave and the onset of a forward decompression wave in mid-late systole. The arrival time of the reflected wave coincided with the time when minor axis shortening began to decline from its peak, even during aortic occlusion when this time is 12 ms earlier. The initial decline in long axis shortening corresponded to the time of the peak of the reflected wave. The forward decompression wave was consistently observed to have a slow and then rapid phase. The slow phase onset coincided with time of maximum shortening velocity of the long axis. The onset of the later larger rapid phase consistently coincided with an increased rate of deceleration of both axes during late systole. Forward decompression waves are generated by the LV when the long axis shortening velocity falls. Reflected wave arrival has a detrimental effect on LV function, particularly the minor axis. These observations lend support to suggestions that therapies directed toward reducing wave reflection may be of value in hypertension and cardiovascular disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Aortic (central) blood pressure (BP) differs from brachial BP and may be a superior predictor of cardiovascular events. However, its measurement is currently restricted to research settings, owing to a moderate level of operator dependency. We tested a new noninvasive device in a large UK cohort. The device estimates central BP using measurements obtained with an upper arm cuff inflated to suprasystolic pressure. We compared these estimates with those obtained using radial tonometry as well as with invasively acquired measurements of aortic BP in a limited number of individuals. METHODS: Consecutive cuff-based and tonometry-based estimates of the pressure waveform and the central BP were obtained from 1107 individuals (70 +/- 6 years). Short-term and long-term reproducibility studies were performed on 28 individuals. Simultaneous cuff-based and invasively measured pressure traces were acquired and compared in an additional six individuals (65 +/- 20 years). RESULTS: Central systolic BP, as estimated by the cuff-based device, was found to be highly reproducible (coefficient of variation 4 and 8% for short and long-term reproducibility, respectively) and was comparable to that estimated by tonometry (average difference 3 +/- 6 mmHg, intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.91). The cuff-based pressure waveforms were similar to those acquired invasively (cross-correlation coefficient 0.93), and the difference in the estimated central systolic BP was -5 +/- 8 mmHg (P = 0.2). CONCLUSION: Cuff-based devices show promise to simplify the measurement of central BP, whilst maintaining a similar fidelity to tonometry. This could lead to improved adoption of estimates of central BP in clinical practice.},

   abstract = {Cardiometabolic risk is elevated in South Asians and African Caribbeans compared with Europeans, yet whether this is associated with ethnic differences in left-ventricular structure is unclear. Conventional M-mode or 2-dimensional echocardiography may be misleading, because they calculate left-ventricular mass and remodeling using geometric assumptions. Left-ventricular structure was compared in a triethnic population-based cohort using conventional and 3-dimensional echocardiography on 895 individuals (aged 55-85 years; 427 European, 325 South Asian, 143 African Caribbean). Left-ventricular mass was indexed, and left-ventricle remodeling index and relative wall thickness were calculated. Anthropometry, blood pressure, and fasting bloods were measured. Three-dimensional left-ventricular mass index did not differ between Europeans (mean +/- SE, 29.8 +/- 0.3 g/m(2.7)) and African Caribbeans (29.9 +/- 0.5 g/m(2.7); P=0.9), but it was significantly lower in South Asians (28.1 +/- 0.4 g/m(2.7); P<0.0001) compared with Europeans. These findings persisted on multivariate adjustment. In contrast, conventional left-ventricle mass index was significantly higher in African Caribbeans (46.4 +/- 0.9 g/m(2.7)) than in Europeans (41.9 +/- 0.5 g/m(2.7); P<0.0001). Left-ventricle remodeling index was the highest in African Caribbeans and the lowest in South Asians. Relative wall thickness was also higher in African Caribbeans, but no different in South Asians, compared with Europeans. Differences in left-ventricle remodeling index were attenuated by adjustment for cardiometabolic factors between African Caribbeans and Europeans only. In conclusion, left-ventricular mass is lower in South Asians and equivalent in African Caribbeans compared with Europeans, even when cardiometabolic risk factors are accounted for. Left-ventricular remodeling rather than hypertrophy may explain the increased risk of heart failure in people of African Caribbean origin.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Changes in ventricular rotation measured by two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (2DSTE) are early indicators of cardiac disease. Data on the clinical feasibility of this important measure are scarce and there is no information on the comparability of different software versions. We assessed the feasibility, reproducibility and within patient temporal variability of 2DSTE in a large community based sample of older adults. We additionally compared 2DSTE results to those generated by 3DSTE. METHODS AND RESULTS: 1408 participants underwent transthoracic echocardiography. Using Philips Qlab 8.1 peak LV rotation at either the base or the apex was analysable in 432 (31%) participants. Peak twist measurements were achieved in 274 (20%) participants. 66 participants were randomly selected for the reproducibility study. 20 additional participants had scans 4-6 weeks apart for temporal variability and 3D echocardiography to assess the agreement between 2DSTE and 3DSTE. Reproducibility was evaluated using the intraclass coefficient of correlation (ICC). Better reproducibility for rotation and twist were obtained when measured at the endocardium, and when using more recent software versions, Peak twist and rotation were significantly different using two versions of the same software. Agreement with 3DSTE was better using newer software. CONCLUSION: Feasibility of 2DSTE is low in this cohort of elderly individuals severely limiting its utility in clinical settings. However if high quality images can be acquired assessment of ventricular rotation by 2DSTE is reproducible. Caution should be taken when comparing measurements of ventricular rotation by software from different vendors or different versions of software from the same vendor.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE Diabetes is associated with left ventricular (LV) diastolic and systolic dysfunction. South Asians may be at particular risk of developing LV dysfunction owing to a high prevalence of diabetes. We investigated the role of diabetes and hyperglycemia in LV dysfunction in a community-based cohort of older South Asians and white Europeans. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Conventional and Doppler echocardiography was performed in 999 participants (542 Europeans and 457 South Asians aged 58-86 years) in a population-based study. Anthropometry, fasting bloods, coronary artery calcification scoring, blood pressure, and renal function were measured. RESULTS Diabetes and hyperglycemia across the spectrum of HbA1c had a greater adverse effect on LV function in South Asians than Europeans (N-terminal-probrain natriuretic peptide beta +/- SE 0.09 +/- 0.04, P = 0.01, vs. -0.04 +/- 0.05, P = 0.4, P for HbA1c/ethnicity interaction 0.02), diastolic function (E/e' 0.69 +/- 0.12, P < 0.0001, vs. 0.09 +/- 0.2, P = 0.6, P for interaction 0.005), and systolic function (s' -0.11 +/- 0.06, P = 0.04, vs. 0.14 +/- 0.09, P = 0.1, P for interaction 0.2). Multivariable adjustment for hypertension, microvascular disease, LV mass, coronary disease, and dyslipidemia only partially accounted for the ethnic differences. Adverse LV function in diabetic South Asians could not be accounted for by poorer glycemic control or longer diabetes duration. CONCLUSIONS Diabetes and hyperglycemia have a greater adverse effect on LV function in South Asians than Europeans, incompletely explained by adverse risk factors. South Asians may require earlier and more aggressive treatment of their cardiometabolic risk factors to reduce risks of LV dysfunction.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Ethnic minority groups in the UK experience marked differences in cardiovascular disease risk. We investigated differences in arterial central haemodynamics, stiffness, and load in a tri-ethnic population-based cohort. METHODS: A total of 1312 participants (70 +/- 6 years) underwent echocardiography and measurement of brachial and central blood pressure to assess central arterial haemodynamics including central pulse pressure (cPP), arterial stiffness [cPP/stroke volume (SV)], systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and load (Ea). RESULTS: Brachial and central SBPs were similar in all ethnic groups. Compared with Europeans, cPP, cPP/SV, and Ea were higher in South Asians. In contrast, cPP/SV was lower in African Caribbeans despite higher mean arterial pressure, higher SVR, and higher diabetes prevalence. cPP/SV and Ea remained significantly higher in South Asians and significantly lower in African Caribbeans after multivariate adjustment. Diabetes and higher HbA1c were more strongly associated with higher cPP/SV in South Asians than in Europeans (Pinteraction = 0.045 and 0.005, respectively); higher HbA1c was also more strongly associated with increased Ea in South Asians than Europeans (Pinteraction = 0.01). There was no evidence of an interaction between glycaemia and cPP/SV in African Caribbeans. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with Europeans, South Asians have unfavorable arterial function. Diabetes and hyperglycaemia have a more deleterious effect on cPP/SV and Ea in South Asians. In contrast, African Caribbeans have more favourable arterial function than Europeans and South Asians. These differences may contribute to the differential ethnic rates of cardiovascular disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subclinical left ventricular (LV) dysfunction has been inconsistently associated with early cognitive impairment, and mechanistic pathways have been poorly considered. We investigated the cross-sectional relationship between LV dysfunction and structural/functional measures of the brain and explored the role of potential mechanisms. METHOD AND RESULTS: A total of 1338 individuals (69+/-6 years) from the Southall and Brent Revisited study underwent echocardiography for systolic (tissue Doppler imaging peak systolic wave) and diastolic (left atrial diameter) assessment. Cognitive function was assessed and total and hippocampal brain volumes were measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Global LV function was assessed by circulating N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. The role of potential mechanistic pathways of arterial stiffness, atherosclerosis, microvascular disease, and inflammation were explored. After adjusting for age, sex, and ethnicity, lower systolic function was associated with lower total brain (beta+/-standard error, 14.9+/-3.2 cm3; P<0.0001) and hippocampal volumes (0.05+/-0.02 cm3, P=0.01). Reduced diastolic function was associated with poorer working memory (-0.21+/-0.07, P=0.004) and fluency scores (-0.18+/-0.08, P=0.02). Reduced global LV function was associated with smaller hippocampal volume (-0.10+/-0.03 cm3, P=0.004) and adverse visual memory (-0.076+/-0.03, P=0.02) and processing speed (0.063+/-0.02, P=0.006) scores. Separate adjustment for concomitant cardiovascular risk factors attenuated associations with hippocampal volume and fluency only. Further adjustment for the alternative pathways of microvascular disease or arterial stiffness attenuated the relationship between global LV function and visual memory. CONCLUSIONS: In a community-based sample of older people, measures of LV function were associated with structural/functional measures of the brain. These associations were not wholly explained by concomitant risk factors or potential mechanistic pathways.},

   abstract = {Within-individual variability of repeatedly measured exposures might predict later outcomes (e.g., blood pressure (BP) variability (BPV) is an independent cardiovascular risk factor above and beyond mean BP). Because 2-stage methods, known to introduce bias, are typically used to investigate such associations, we introduce a joint modeling approach, examining associations of mean BP and BPV across childhood with left ventricular mass (indexed to height; LVMI) in early adulthood with data (collected 1990-2011) from the UK Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort. Using multilevel models, we allowed BPV to vary between individuals (a "random effect") as well as to depend on covariates (allowing for heteroskedasticity). We further distinguished within-clinic variability ("measurement error") from visit-to-visit BPV. BPV was predicted to be greater at older ages, at higher body weights, and in female participants and was positively correlated with mean BP. BPV had a weak positive association with LVMI (10% increase in within-individual BP variance was predicted to increase LVMI by 0.21%, 95% credible interval: -0.23, 0.69), but this association became negative (-0.78%, 95% credible interval: -2.54, 0.22) once the effect of mean BP on LVMI was adjusted for. This joint modeling approach offers a flexible method of relating repeatedly measured exposures to later outcomes.},

   abstract = {1. The effect of noradrenaline and the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, azepexole, on tone and intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) was examined in human isolated subcutaneous resistance arteries. Isolated arteries were mounted on an isometric myograph and loaded with the Ca2+ indicator, fura-2, for simultaneous measurement of force and [Ca2+]i. 2. High potassium solution (KPSS), noradrenaline and azepexole increased [Ca2+]i and contracted subcutaneous arteries in physiological saline. When extracellular Ca2+ was removed and the calcium chelator, BAPTA, added to the physiological saline (PSSo), responses to noradrenaline were transient and reduced, and responses to azepexole were markedly inhibited. 3. Ryanodine, an agent which interferes with Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, had little effect on contractile responses to KPSS, noradrenaline or azepexole in physiological saline. The response to caffeine in physiological saline was inhibited by ryanodine. In PSSo, ryanodine partially inhibited contractile responses to noradrenaline and azepexole, and completely abolished the response to caffeine. 4. Noradrenaline and azepexole both significantly increased maximum force achieved by cumulative addition of Ca2+ to a Ca(2+)-free depolarizing solution and shifted the calculated relationship between [Ca2+]i and force to the left, suggesting these agents increase the sensitivity of the contractile apparatus to [Ca2+]i. 5. (-)-202 791, a dihydropyridine antagonist of voltage-operated calcium channels partially inhibited both the contractile response and the rise in [Ca2+]i induced by azepexole. Pre-treatment of arteries with pertussis toxin inhibited responses to azepexole, but had no significant effect on tone induced by KPSS or noradrenaline. ETYA, an inhibitor of phospholipase A2, lipoxygenase and cyclo-oxygenase, had no effect on azepexole-induced contraction in the presence of N omega nitro-L-arginine methyl ester.6. Azepexole, a selective alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist, contracts human subcutaneous resistance arteries by a mechanism largely dependent on the influx of extracellular Ca2", probably through voltage-operated calcium channels. This action involves a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, possibly Gi.},

   abstract = {1 Human subcutaneous resistance arteries (internal diameter 113-626-mu-m) were mounted in an isometric myograph. Electrical field stimulation was applied either continuously in the form of a frequency-response curve or intermittently at 16 Hz. The magnitude of the maximum contraction induced by continuous stimulation expressed as a percentage of the response to a supramaximal concentration of noradrenaline (10-mu-M) was highly variable but unrelated to vessel calibre. Contractile responses to both continuous and intermittent stimulation were abolished by 1-mu-M tetrodotoxin.
2 Prazosin (100 nM and 1-mu-M, al-adrenoceptor antagonist) inhibited responses to continuous stimulation over a range of frequencies (2-8 Hz). The response to continuous stimulation at 8 Hz was inhibited by 78 +/- 6% by 1-mu-M prazosin. Rauwolscine (100 nm, alpha-2-adrenoceptor antagonist) had a smaller effect on contractions induced by continuous stimulation. Rauwolscine inhibited the response at 8 Hz by 36 +/- 6%. Rauwolscine at a higher concentration (1-mu-M) caused further inhibition of the response to continuous stimulation. Prazosin and rauwolscine in combination almost completely inhibited the response to continuous stimulation at concentrations of 1-mu-M.
3 Prazosin and rauwolscine inhibited responses to intermittent stimulation in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC50 for this action of prazosin was 3.7 +/- 1.6 nM and the maximum inhibition induced by 100 nM prazosin was 78 +/- 6%. The IC50 of rauwolscine was 12.0 +/- 1.3 nM and 100 nM rauwolscine caused a 86 +/- 7% reduction in the response to intermittent stimulation. Prazosin and rauwolscine in combination (each at 100 nM) caused marked inhibition of the response to intermittent stimulation leaving only 7.0 +/- 2.6% of the response.
4 These data suggest that neurally released noradrenaline evokes contractions of human resistance arteries by activation of both alpha-1- and alpha-2-adrenoceptors postjunctionally.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The coexistence of wild-type transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR) is common in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). However, the impact of ATTR and AS on the resultant AS-ATTR is unclear and poses diagnostic and management challenges. We therefore used a multicohort approach to evaluate myocardial structure, function, stress and damage by assessing age-related, afterload-related and amyloid-related remodelling on the resultant AS-ATTR phenotype. METHODS: We compared four samples (n=583): 359 patients with AS, 107 with ATTR (97% Perugini grade 2), 36 with AS-ATTR (92% Perugini grade 2) and 81 age-matched and ethnicity-matched controls. (99m)Tc-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid (DPD) scintigraphy was used to diagnose amyloidosis (Perugini grade 1 was excluded). The primary end-point was NT-pro Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) and secondary end-points related to myocardial structure, function and damage. RESULTS: Compared with older age controls, the three disease cohorts had greater cardiac remodelling, worse function and elevated NT-proBNP/high-sensitivity Troponin-T (hsTnT). NT-proBNP was higher in AS-ATTR (2844 (1745, 4635) ng/dL) compared with AS (1294 (1077, 1554)ng/dL; p=0.002) and not significantly different to ATTR (3272 (2552, 4197) ng/dL; p=0.63). Diastology, hsTnT and prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome were statistically similar between AS-ATTR and ATTR and higher than AS. The left ventricular mass indexed in AS-ATTR was lower than ATTR (139 (112, 167) vs 180 (167, 194) g; p=0.013) and non-significantly different to AS (120 (109, 130) g; p=0.179). CONCLUSIONS: The AS-ATTR phenotype likely reflects an early stage of amyloid infiltration, but the combined insult resembles ATTR. Even after treatment of AS, ATTR-specific therapy is therefore likely to be beneficial.},

   abstract = {Objectives The aims of this study were to characterize the angiotensin II receptor subtype present on vascular smooth muscle cells from human saphenous vein and to assess the effect of angiotensin II on the expression of the early growth response gene c-fos and on DNA synthesis.
Methods and results Using radioligand binding studies, we have defined the angiotensin II receptors present on these cells as being predominantly of the AT(1) subtype. Angiotensin II increased peak intracellular calcium levels by 126+/-16 nmol/l (mean+/-SEM) in 17/49 cultures. Angiotensin II induced c-fos expression in a concentration-dependent manner only in cultures that exhibited an intracellular calcium transient in response to stimulation with angiotensin II, The induction of c-fos was inhibited by the selective AT(1) antagonist losartan in accordance with the binding studies. Angiotensin II stimulated DNA synthesis with a maximal increase of 66.4%+/-20.5% over serum-free levels at 1 nmol/l (mean +/- SEM, n = 6, P < 0.05). DNA synthesis declined with increasing angiotensin II concentration, falling to control values at 1 mu mol/l, suggesting that a growth-inhibitory influence may counterbalance the stimulatory effect that is observed at lower concentrations.
Conclusion Vascular smooth muscle cells from human saphenous vein possess predominantly AT(1) receptors and in response to angiotensin II show an induction of c-fos and a modest increase in DNA synthesis.},

An increase in intracellular Ca2+ [Ca2+]i is an important signal in chemotaxis, but the role of L-type calcium channels (CaV1.2) in this response in human vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMC) has not been examined. hVSMC were grown from explant cultures of saphenous vein. Confluent hVSMC at passage 3 were studied after culture in medium containing 15% foetal calf serum (FCS) (randomly cycling) or following serum deprivation for up to 7 days. Smooth muscle alpha-actin was measured by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. [Ca2+]i was measured using fura 2 fluorimetry. Chemotaxis was measured using a modified Boyden chamber technique and cell attachment to gelatin-coated plates was also quantified. The number and affinity of dihydropyridine-binding sites was assessed using [5-methyl-3H]PN 200-110 binding. In randomly cycling cells, the calcium channel agonist, Bay K 8644a and 100 mM KCl did not affect [Ca2+]i. In addition, the rise in [Ca2+]i induced by platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF) was unaffected by the CaV1.2 antagonists, amlodipine and verapamil. In randomly cycling cells amlodipine did not affect PDGF-induced migration. In serum-deprived cells, smooth muscle alpha-actin was increased and Bay K 8644a and 100 mM KCl increased [Ca2+]i. PDGF-induced rises in [Ca2+]i were also inhibited by amlodipine and verapamil. The ability of Bay K 8644a to increase [Ca2+]i and verapamil to inhibit PDGF-induced rises in [Ca2+]i was evident within 3 days after serum withdrawal. In serum-deprived hVSMC Bay K 8644a induced chemotaxis and amlodipine inhibited PDGF-induced migration. Cell attachment in the presence of PDGF was unaffected by amlodipine in either randomly cycling or serum-deprived hVSMC. Serum withdrawal was associated with a decrease in the maximum number of dihydropyridine-binding sites (B(max)) and a decrease in affinity (K(D)). Serum deprivation of hVSMC results in increased expression of smooth muscle alpha-actin, a marker of more differentiated status, and increased [Ca2+]i responses and chemotaxis mediated by CaV1.2. These observations may have important implications for understanding the therapeutic benefits of calcium channel antagonists in cardiovascular disease.},

   abstract = {Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is a matricellular protein that is present in negligible amounts in normal human vasculature but occurs in significant amounts in diseased vessels. In this study, we examined the effect of TSP-1 on DNA synthesis, proliferation, and migration in human vascular smooth muscle cells grown from saphenous vein. TSP-1 (0.1 to 30 micrograms/mL) elicited a concentration-dependent increase in DNA synthesis under serum-free conditions. In combination with platelet-derived growth factor, TSP-1 induced a synergistic effect on DNA synthesis that was significantly higher than the additive effect of both agents. In proliferation assays, TSP-1 increased cell numbers by 50% relative to the serum-free controls over 14 days. In migration assays, conducted using modified Boyden chambers, TSP-1 (> or = 10 micrograms/mL) elicited marked chemotaxis to a degree equivalent to platelet-derived growth factor. The chemotactic response to TSP-1 (10 micrograms/mL) was abolished by the GRGDSP peptide but unaffected by the control GRGESP peptide, whereas neither peptide inhibited DNA synthesis stimulated by TSP-1. Inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity with genistein or tyrphostin A23 abolished DNA synthesis induced by TSP-1, and a neutralizing antibody to platelet-derived growth factor had no effect on DNA synthesis. Similarly, migration in response to TSP-1 was largely inhibited by these tyrosine kinase inhibitors. TSP-1 is a strong mitogen and chemoattractant for human vascular smooth muscle cells under serum-free conditions. The novel finding that TSP-1 is mitogenic for human cells contrasts with previous studies that have not shown any significant effect of TSP-1 itself on the growth of animal-derived smooth muscle cells. TSP-1 may play an important modulatory role in the local regulation of vascular smooth muscle function in vascular pathologies in humans.},

   abstract = {The sulphated polysaccharides fucoidan and heparin both inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation. In this study we compared their actions on mitogenesis and ERK1/ERK2 activation in human VSMC. Although they displaced cell surface [3H]-heparin binding with similar affinity, they exerted clearly distinguishable actions. Fucoidan potently inhibited DNA synthesis stimulated by foetal calf serum, PDGF-BB and thrombospondin-1. Heparin inhibited the mitogenic action of serum and thrombospondin- I (though less potently than fucoidan), but failed to inhibit PDGF-BB-induced DNA synthesis. In parallel studies, fucoidan, but not heparin, inhibited ERK1/ERK2 activation by PDGF-BB. Moreover, fucoidan inhibited serum-induced mitogenesis in "heparin resistant" VSMC, which are refractory to heparin's antimitogenic action. In summary, the structurally different polysaccharides, heparin, fucoidan (and fucans) have distinguishable effects on mitogenesis and ERK1/ERK2 activation, suggesting that different mechanism(s) mediate these actions. The potent antimitogenic action of fucoidan and its efficacy in heparin resistant VSMC emphasise the need to further investigate its mechanism of action in human VSMC and suggest this agent could have therapeutic potential.},

   abstract = {1. The glycosaminoglycan heparin inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration, but the mechanism of its antiproliferative action remains unclear. Heparin has been reported to bind to high affinity cell surface sites on animal VSMC before undergoing receptor mediated endocytosis resulting in signal transduction into the cytoplasm and modulation of genes involved in proliferation. In this study, we have characterized the binding of [3H]-heparin to human saphenous vein-derived VSMC and examined whether there is any relationship between the affinity of [3H]-heparin binding and the inhibitory effect of heparin and its structural analogues on DNA synthesis. 2. At 4 degrees C [3H]-heparin binding to human VSMC occurred in a specific, time and concentration-dependent manner and was not influenced by the removal of calcium ions. Binding of the ligand appeared to occur to the cell surface and was both saturable and reversible. Kinetic and steady state data indicated a single class of binding sites. 3. The pharmacology of [3H]-heparin binding was examined in displacement studies using unlabelled heparin and structural analogues. A comparison of the rank potencies of heparin, heparan sulphate fraction II, low molecular weight heparin and trehalose octasulphate showed that there was a marked discrepancy between their estimated affinities in the binding assays and their effect on DNA synthesis. 4. In summary, we have characterized the heparin binding site on human saphenous vein-derived VSMC. Our findings suggest that the action of heparin and its analogues on DNA synthesis does not simply reflect an interaction with the cell-associated heparin binding site defined in these studies, but may also be determined by the internalization and metabolism of the glycosaminoglycan(s).},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the association of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with central and peripheral blood pressure (BP), in a general adolescent population and to examine whether associations are independent of adiposity. METHODS: Using cross-sectional data from a subsample (N = 1904) of a UK birth cohort, we assessed markers of NAFLD including ultrasound scan (USS) determined fatty liver, shear velocity (marker of liver fibrosis), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) at a mean age of 17.8 years. These were related to BP [central and peripheral SBP and DBP and mean arterial pressure (MAP)]. RESULTS: Fatty liver was positively associated with central and peripheral SBP, DBP and MAP in models adjusting for age, sex, social class, puberty and alcohol intake. These positive associations were attenuated to the null when fat mass was included. For example, in confounder-adjusted models, not including fat mass, mean central SBP was 3.74 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12 to 6.36] higher in adolescents with USS fatty liver than in those without; with additional adjustment for fat mass, the association attenuated to the null value (-0.37 mmHg; 95% CI -3.09 to 2.36). Similar patterns were found for associations of ALT and GGT with central and peripheral BP. There was no consistent evidence of associations of shear velocity or AST with BP measurements. Fatty liver was not consistently associated with central pulse pressure (PP), peripheral PP and Aix@75. CONCLUSION: NAFLD is not associated with higher central or peripheral BP in adolescents once confounding by adiposity is taken into account.},

   abstract = {Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are widely used in the management of hypertension, but recently the equivalence of hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone for blood pressure (BP) lowering and prevention of cardiovascular disease has been questioned. We performed a meta-analysis to characterize the dose-response relationships for 3 commonly prescribed thiazide diuretics, hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, and bendroflumethiazide, on BP, serum potassium, and urate. Randomized, double-blind, parallel placebo-controlled trials meeting the following criteria, >/= 2 different monotherapy dose arms, follow-up duration >/= 4 weeks, and baseline washout of medication >/= 2 weeks, were identified using Embase (1980-2010 week 50), Medline (1950-2010 November week 3), metaRegister of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Central. A total of 26 trials examined hydrochlorothiazide, 3 examined chlorthalidone, and 1 examined bendroflumethiazide. Studies included a total of 4683 subjects in >53 comparison arms. Meta-regression of the effect of thiazides on systolic BP showed a log-linear relationship with a potency series: bendroflumethiazide>chlorthalidone>hydrochlorothiazide. The estimated dose of each drug predicted to reduce systolic BP by 10 mm Hg was 1.4, 8.6, and 26.4 mg, respectively, and there was no evidence of a difference in maximum reduction of systolic BP by high doses of different thiazides. Potency series for diastolic BP, serum potassium, and urate were similar to those seen for systolic BP. Hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, and bendroflumethiazide have markedly different potency. This may account for differences in the antihypertensive effect between hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone using standard dose ranges.},

   abstract = {AIMS: To evaluate the classification agreement between instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) and fractional flow reserve (FFR) in patients with angiographic intermediate coronary stenoses. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three hundred and twelve patients (339 stenoses) with angiographically intermediate stenoses were included in this international clinical registry. The iFR was calculated using fully automated algorithms. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to identify the iFR optimal cut-point corresponding to FFR 0.8. The classification agreement of coronary stenoses as significant or non-significant was established between iFR and FFR and between repeated FFR measurements for each 0.05 quantile of FFR values, from 0.2 to 1. Close agreement was observed between iFR and FFR (area under ROC curve= 86%). The optimal iFR cut-off (for an FFR of 0.80) was 0.89. After adjustment for the intrinsic variability of FFR, the classification agreement (accuracy) between iFR and FFR was 94%. Amongst the stenoses classified as non-significant by iFR (>0.89) and as significant by FFR (</=0.8), 81% had associated FFR values located within the FFR "grey-zone" (0.75-0.8) and 41% within the 0.79-0.80 FFR range. CONCLUSIONS: In a population of intermediate coronary stenoses, the classification agreement between iFR and FFR is excellent and similar to that of repeated FFR measurements in the same sample. Vasodilator-independent assessment of intermediate stenosis seems applicable and may foster adoption of coronary physiology in the catheterisation laboratory.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Adoption of fractional flow reserve (FFR) remains low (6-8%), partly because of the time, cost and potential inconvenience associated with vasodilator administration. The instantaneous wave-Free Ratio (iFR) is a pressure-only index of stenosis severity calculated without vasodilator drugs. Before outcome trials test iFR as a sole guide to revascularisation, we evaluate the merits of a hybrid iFR-FFR decision-making strategy for universal physiological assessment. METHODS AND RESULTS: Coronary pressure traces from 577 stenoses were analysed. iFR was calculated as the ratio between Pd and Pa in the resting diastolic wave-free window. A hybrid iFR-FFR strategy was evaluated, by allowing iFR to defer some stenoses (where negative predictive value is high) and treat others (where positive predictive value is high), with adenosine being given only to patients with iFR in between those values. For the most recent fixed FFR cut-off (0.8), an iFR of <0.86 could be used to confirm treatment (PPV of 92%), whilst an iFR value of >0.93 could be used to defer revascularisation (NPV of 91%). Limiting vasodilator drugs to cases with iFR values between 0.86 to 0.93 would obviate the need for vasodilator drugs in 57% of patients, whilst maintaining 95% agreement with an FFR-only strategy. If the 0.75-0.8 FFR grey zone is accounted for, vasodilator drug requirement would decrease by 76%. CONCLUSION: A hybrid iFR-FFR decision-making strategy for revascularisation could increase adoption of physiology-guided PCI, by more than halving the need for vasodilator administration, whilst maintaining high classification agreement with an FFR-only strategy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coronary flow reserve has extensive validation as a prognostic marker in coronary disease. Although pressure-only fractional flow reserve (FFR) improves outcomes compared with angiography when guiding percutaneous coronary intervention, it disagrees with coronary flow reserve classification 30% of the time. We evaluated whether baseline instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) could provide an improved pressure-only estimation of underlying coronary flow reserve. METHODS AND RESULTS: Invasive pressure and flow velocity were measured in 216 stenoses from 186 patients with coronary disease. The diagnostic relationship between pressure-only indices (iFR and FFR) and coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) was compared using correlation coefficient and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. iFR showed a stronger correlation with underlying CFVR (iFR-CFVR, rho=0.68 versus FFR-CFVR, rho=0.50; P<0.001). iFR also agreed more closely with CFVR in stenosis classification (iFR area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.82 versus FFR area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.72; P<0.001, for a CFVR of 2). The closer relationship between iFR and CFVR was found for different CFVR cutoffs and was particularly marked in the 0.6 to 0.9 FFR range. Hyperemic FFR flow was similar to baseline iFR flow in functionally significant lesions (FFR </=0.75; mean FFR flow, 25.8+/-13.7 cm/s versus mean iFR flow, 21.5+/-11.7 cm/s; P=0.13). FFR flow was higher than iFR flow in nonsignificant stenoses (FFR >0.75; mean FFR flow, 42.3+/-22.8 cm/s versus mean iFR flow, 26.1+/-15.5 cm/s; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: When compared with FFR, iFR shows stronger correlation and better agreement with CFVR. These results provide physiological evidence that iFR could potentially be used as a functional index of disease severity, independently from its agreement with FFR.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Metformin might reduce insulin requirement and improve glycaemia in patients with type 1 diabetes, but whether it has cardiovascular benefits is unknown. We aimed to investigate whether metformin treatment (added to titrated insulin therapy) reduced atherosclerosis, as measured by progression of common carotid artery intima-media thickness (cIMT), in adults with type 1 diabetes at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. METHODS: REMOVAL was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial undertaken at 23 hospital diabetes clinics in five countries (Australia, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, and the UK). Adults aged 40 years and older with type 1 diabetes of at least 5 years' duration and at least three of ten specific cardiovascular risk factors were randomly assigned (via an interactive voice response system) to oral metformin 1000 mg twice daily or placebo. Participants and site staff were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was averaged mean far-wall cIMT, quantified annually for 3 years, analysed in a modified intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned participants with post-randomisation data available for the outcome of interest at any given timepoint, irrespective of subsequent adherence or study participation), using repeated measures regression. Secondary outcomes were HbA1c, LDL cholesterol, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), incident microalbuminuria (not reported), incident retinopathy, bodyweight, insulin dose, and endothelial function, also analysed in all participants with post-randomisation data available for the outcome of interest at any given timepoint. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01483560. FINDINGS: Between Dec 14, 2011, and June 24, 2014, 493 participants entered a 3 month run-in to optimise risk factor and glycaemic control (single-blind placebo in the final month). Of 428 randomly assigned patients, 219 were allocated to metformin and 209 to placebo. Progression of mean cIMT was not significantly reduced with metformin (-0.005 mm per year, 95% CI -0.012 to 0.002; p=0.1664), although maximal cIMT (a prespecified tertiary outcome) was significantly reduced (-0.013 mm per year, -0.024 to -0.003; p=0.0093). HbA1c (mean 8.1% [SD 0.9] for metformin and 8.0% [0.8] for placebo at baseline) was reduced on average over 3 years by metformin (-0.13%, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.037; p=0.0060), but this was accounted for by a reduction at the 3-month timepoint (-0.24%, -0.34 to -0.13; p<0.0001) that was not sustained thereafter (p=0.0163 for visit-by-treatment interaction). Bodyweight (-1.17 kg, 95% CI -1.66 to -0.69; p<0.0001) and LDL cholesterol (-0.13 mmol/L, -0.24 to -0.03; p=0.0117) were reduced with metformin over 3 years of treatment, and eGFR was increased (4.0 mL/min per 1.73m(2), 2.19 to 5.82; p<0.0001). Insulin requirement was not reduced on average over 3 years (-0.005 units per kg, 95% CI -0.022 to 0.012; p=0.545), but there was a significant visit-by-treatment interaction (p=0.0018). There was no effect on endothelial function as measured by reactive hyperaemia index, or on retinopathy. Discontinuation of treatment in 59 (27%) participants on metformin versus 26 (12%) on placebo (p=0.0002) was mainly due to an excess of gastrointestinal adverse effects, and there was no increase in hypoglycaemia with metformin. Five deaths occurred among patients allocated to metformin and two occurred among those allocated to placebo; none were judged by site principal investigators to be related to study medication. INTERPRETATION: These data do not support use of metformin to improve glycaemic control in adults with long-standing type 1 diabetes as suggested by current guidelines, but suggest that it might have a wider role in cardiovascular risk management.

   abstract = {AIMS: Cardiovascular (CV) disease is a major cause of reduced life expectancy in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Intensive insulin therapy prevents CV complications but is constrained by hypoglycaemia and weight gain. Adjunct metformin reduces insulin dose requirement and stabilizes weight but there are no data on its cardiovascular effects. We have therefore initiated an international double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (REMOVAL: REducing with MetfOrmin Vascular Adverse Lesions in type 1 diabetes) to examine whether metformin reduces progression of atherosclerosis in adults with T1D. Individuals >/=40 years of age with T1D for >/=5 years are eligible if they have >/=3 of 10 specified CV risk factors. The enrolment target is 500 participants in 17 international centres. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After 12 weeks of single-blind placebo-controlled run-in, participants with >/= 70% adherence are randomized to metformin or matching placebo for 3 years with insulin titrated towards HbA1c 7.0% (53 mmol/mol). The primary endpoint is progression of averaged mean far wall common carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) measured by ultrasonography at baseline, 12, 24 and 36 months. This design provides 90% power to detect a mean difference of 0.0167 mm in cIMT progression between treatment arms (alpha = 0.05), assuming that up to 20% withdraw or discontinue treatment. Other endpoints include HbA1c, weight, LDL cholesterol, insulin requirement, progression of retinopathy, endothelial function and frequency of hypoglycaemia. CONCLUSION: REMOVAL is the largest clinical trial of adjunct metformin therapy in T1D to date and will provide clinically meaningful information on its potential to impact CV disease and other complications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In humans, hemodynamic changes observed within minutes after systemic administration of furosemide are often referred to as direct vasoactivity. However, these immediate changes do not per se imply a direct vascular effect. We examined the genuine direct vascular effects of furosemide on the human forearm vascular bed and dorsal hand vein. METHODS AND RESULTS: Forearm blood flow in response to infusion of increasing dosages of furosemide into the brachial artery was recorded by venous occlusion plethysmography. Local plasma concentrations of furosemide reached a maximum of 234+/-40 microg/mL during the highest infused dose but did not significantly affect the ratio of flow in the infused/noninfused arms. Venous distensibility of a dorsal hand vein was measured with a linear variable differential transformer. During precontraction with norepinephrine, five increasing dosages of furosemide (1 to 100 microg/min) were administered locally. Additional experiments using local administration of indomethacin or N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) were carried out to determine whether effects were dependent on local prostaglandin or nitric oxide synthesis, respectively. Also, the effects of systemic administration of furosemide were examined. Local administration of furosemide led to a dose-dependent venorelaxation of 18+/-6% at the first to 72+/-16% at the last dose. Indomethacin almost completely abolished furosemide-induced venorelaxation, whereas L-NMMA had no effect. Systemic administration of furosemide resulted in a time-dependent increase of hand vein distensibility, reaching 45+/-11% after 8 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: Furosemide does not exert any direct arterial vasoactivity in the human forearm, even at supratherapeutic concentrations. In contrast, at concentrations estimated to be in the therapeutic range, we observed a dose-dependent direct venodilator effect on the dorsal hand vein that appears to be mediated by local vascular prostaglandin synthesis.},

   abstract = {Hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to exert direct vasodilator effects by activation of calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channels in human and guinea pig isolated resistance arteries. Since hydrochlorothiazide binds to and inhibits the enzyme carbonic anhydrase and because KCa channel activation is pH sensitive, we investigated the role of intracellular and extracellular carbonic anhydrase in the vascular effects of thiazide diuretics. Small arteries were isolated from guinea pig mesentery and studied by use of a microvascular myograph technique. In some experiments, tone and intracellular pH (pHi) were measured simultaneously with 2', 7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)'-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF-AM). Bendroflumethiazide, a thiazide diuretic with minimal inhibitory effects on carbonic anhydrase, had little effect on noradrenaline-induced tone (16+/-8% relaxation) compared with hydrochlorothiazide (74+/-12% relaxation). In contrast to hydrochlorothiazide, the action of bendroflumethiazide was unaffected by 100 nmol/L charybdotoxin, a selective blocker of KCa channels. All inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase relaxed noradrenaline-induced tone in a concentration-dependent manner, and this effect was blocked by charybdotoxin. Hydrochlorothiazide and the inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase failed to relax tone induced by a depolarizing potassium solution. Acetazolamide and hydrochlorothiazide increased pHi by 0.27+/-0.07 and 0.21+/-0.04, respectively, whereas bendroflumethiazide had a much smaller effect: 0.06+/-0.03. The rise in pHi induced by any agent was not inhibited by charybdotoxin. The vasorelaxant effect of hydrochlorothiazide is shared by other inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase. Inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase, but not bendroflumethiazide, cause intracellular alkalinization, which is associated with KCa channel opening. These data suggest that the vasodilator effect of thiazide diuretics results primarily from inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell carbonic anhydrase, which results in a rise in pHI, leading to KCa channel activation and vasorelaxation.},

   abstract = {1. We examined the effect of the thiazide diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide, on on intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and tone in guinea-pig mesentery arteries. Vessels were mounted on a microvascular myograph and loaded with the Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorescent dye, Fura-2. 2. Hydrochlorothiazide caused relaxation of noradrenaline-precontracted arteries associated with a fall in [Ca2+]i. Preincubation of arteries with hydrochlorothiazide inhibited both contraction and rise in [Ca2+]i in response to noradrenaline. Hydrochlorothiazide did not affect tone and [Ca2+]i when this was elevated by a combination of depolarizing potassium solution and noradrenaline. 3. Hydrochlorothiazide-induced vasorelaxation and decrease of [Ca2+]i was abolished by charybdotoxin, a blocker of large conductance Ca(2+)-activated K channels. 4. The rise in [Ca2+]i elicited by caffeine in Ca(2+)-free physiological salt solution, and presumably reflecting Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, was not altered by preincubation with hydrochlorothiazide. 5. Under depolarizing conditions hydrochlorothiazide did not alter the relationship between the extracellular concentration of Ca2+ and [Ca2+]i; however, hydrochlorothiazide caused a small reduction in the contraction produced for a given rise in [Ca2+]i suggesting hydrochlorothiazide may cause a slight desensitization of the contractile machinery. 6. These findings suggest that hydrochlorothiazide opens Ca(2+)-activated K channels leading to hyperpolarization and consequent closing of voltage-operated calcium channels. The result of this is an impaired influx of extracellular Ca2+, a decrease in [Ca2+]i and vasorelaxation.},

   abstract = {1. The selective carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide is known to increase blood flow in several organs. Acetazolamide directly dilates isolated resistance arteries associated with activation of calcium-activated potassium (K(Ca)) channels. We examined both the presence and mechanism of the direct vascular action of acetazolamide in vivo in humans. 2. Forearm vasodilator responses of 30 healthy volunteers to infusion of placebo and increasing doses of acetazolamide (1-3-10 mg min(-1) dl(-1)) into the brachial artery were recorded by venous occlusion plethysmography, before and after local administration of L-NMMA (0.2 mg min(-1) dl(-1), an inhibitor of NO-synthase, n=6), indomethacin (5.0 microg min(-1) dl(-1), an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, n=6), glibenclamide (10 microg min(-1) dl(-1), an inhibitor of K(ATP) channels, n=6), tetraethylammonium (0.1 mg min(-1) dl(-1), an inhibitor of K(Ca) channels, n=6) or placebo (NaCl 0.9%, n=6). Lower dosages of acetazolamide did not affect vascular tone (n=6). 3. Acetazolamide infusions increased forearm blood flow from 2.41+/-0.17 to 2.99+/-0.18, 4.09+/-0.26 and 6.77+/-0.49 ml min(-1) dl(-1) in the infused forearm (P:<0.001), with no significant changes in the non-infused forearm, blood pressure or heart rate. Acetazolamide-induced vasodilation was not inhibited by L-NMMA, indomethacin, or glibenclamide but was significantly attenuated by TEA (vasodilation: 23+/-6, 82+/-19, 241+/-38% versus 27+/-8, 44+/-22, 42+/-35%). 4. We conclude that acetazolamide exerts a direct vasodilator effect in vivo in humans mediated by vascular K(Ca) channel activation. This makes acetazolamide the first drug known that specifically modulates this channel.},

   abstract = {Hydrochlorothiazide and indapamide are thought to exert their hypotensive efficacy through a combined vasodilator and diuretic effect, but in vivo evidence for a direct vascular effect is lacking. The presence and mechanism of a direct vascular action of hydrochlorothiazide in vivo in humans were examined and compared with those of the thiazide-like drug indapamide. Forearm vasodilator responses to infusion of placebo and increasing doses of hydrochlorothiazide (8, 25, and 75 mu g . min(-1) . dL(-1)) into the brachial artery were recorded by venous occlusion plethysmography. Dose-response curves were repeated after local tetraethylammonium (TEA) administration to determine the role of potassium channel activation and, in patients with the Gitelman syndrome, to determine the role of the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter in the vasodilator effect of hydrochlorothiazide. Vascular effects of hydrochlorothiazide were compared with those of indapamide in both normotensive (mean arterial pressure, 85+/-7 mm Hg) and hypertensive (mean arterial pressure, 124+/-16 mm Hg) subjects. At the highest infusion rate, local plasma concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide averaged 11.0+/-1.6 mu g/mL, and those of indapamide averaged 7.2+/-1.5 mu g/mL. In contrast to indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide showed a direct vascular effect (maximal vasodilation, 55+/-14%; P=0.013), which was inhibited by TEA (maximal vasodilation after TEA, 13+/-10%; P=0.02). The response was not dependent on blood pressure and was similar in patients with Gitelman syndrome, indicating that absence of the Na-CI cotransporter does not alter the vasodilatory effect of hydrochlorothiazide. The vasodilator effect of hydrochlorothiazide in the human forearm is small and only occurs at high concentrations. The mechanism of action is not mediated by inhibition of vascular Na-Cl cotransport but involves vascular potassium channel activation. In contrast, indapamide does not exert any direct vasoactivity in the forearm vascular bed.},

We examined the effects of furosemide (10(-6)-10(-3) mol l(-1)) in comparison with bumetanide (10(-6)-10(-4) mol l(-1)) on isolated resistance arteries from rat and guinea pig mesentery and human subcutaneous fat, and investigated the mechanism of the acute direct vasorelaxant action on an isometric microvascular myograph. Both loop diuretics induced concentration-dependent relaxation of resistance vessels irrespective of membrane potential. The maximal effect of furosemide was greatest in rat and least in human arteries. Both diuretics caused a rightward shift in the concentration-response curve to extracellular Ca(2+). Incubation with indomethacin (2 x 10(-5) mol l(-1)) or mechanical removal of the endothelium did not inhibit the loop diuretic-induced relaxation. At high concentrations (10(-4)-10(-3) mol l(-1)) loop diuretics exert only weak direct relaxant effects on isolated human subcutaneous resistance arteries compared to the vasorelaxant effects in rat and guinea pig mesenteric vessels.},

   abstract = {Background: Recently, hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to relax vascular smooth muscle in vitro in clinically relevant concentrations by the opening of calcium-activated potassium channels, leading to hyperpolarization and consequent closing of voltage-operated calcium channels. Long-term administration of hydrochlorothiazide reduces peripheral vascular resistance in vivo in man. These results indicate that hydrochlorothiazide has hemodynamic activity, and we therefore examined the direct vascular action of this drug in vivo.
Subjects and methods: Forearm vasodilator responses to the infusion of a placebo and five increasing doses of hydrochlorothiazide into the brachial artery were recorded by venous occlusion strain-gauge plethysmography (perfused forearm technique) in eight normotensive male volunteers. Venous samples were taken from an ipsilateral antecubital vein at the end of each infusion period to measure the hydrochlorothiazide concentration.
Results and discussion: Plasma concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide averaged 3.5 +/- 0.3 mu g/ml at the highest infusion rate. This concentration leads to a 60 +/- 10% relaxation in vitro and is more than 10 times the therapeutic plasma concentration. Despite these supratherapeutic levels, we were unable to demonstrate a change in forearm blood flow and vascular resistance. Also, no significant changes were observed in blood pressure and heart rate.
Conclusion: In contrast to in vitro results, hydrochlorothiazide does not exert any direct vasoactivity in the forearm vascular bed of healthy normotensive male volunteers at (supra)therapeutic plasma concentrations.},

   abstract = {Besides an evident diuretic effect, amiloride has been shown to exert direct vasoactivity in various animal experiments, whereas human data on this issue are lacking. Inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange, alpha-adrenergic blockade, and sodium and calcium channel antagonism have been proposed as possible mechanisms of this action. Although the role of Na+/H+ exchange in vascular-tone modulation is not completely clear, various vasoconstrictive agents (e.g., angiotensin II) enhance its activity. We examined the direct effects of amiloride on human arterial vasculature in vivo. Forearm vasodilator responses to the infusion of placebo and amiloride (n = 10; 0.1-100 microg/min/dl) into the brachial artery were recorded by venous occlusion strain-gauge plethysmography. Reduction of forearm blood flow after local administration of noradrenaline or angiotensin II was measured before and after local amiloride administration. Amiloride increased the ratio of the infused/ noninfused forearm blood flow at the highest dosages (10, 30, and 100 microg/min/dl with 14+/-9, 17+/-14, 58+/-23% (p = 0.002, repeated-measures analysis of variance). In contrast to noradrenaline-induced vasoconstriction, the vasoconstrictor response to angiotensin II was significantly attenuated by amiloride (p = 0.02). At high concentrations, amiloride exerts direct vasodilator activity in human arterial vasculature in vivo. This effect appears not to depend on alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade, but shows interaction with angiotensin II, an activator of Na+/ H+ exchange.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systolic blood pressure (SBP) amplification is a physiological phenomenon related to the level of pressure difference between the aorta and brachial artery and is associated with cuff blood pressure (BP) measurement inaccuracy. However, knowledge on the invasively measured level of aortic-to-brachial SBP amplification is limited. This study aimed to explore this, as well as anticipated effects on hypertension classification. METHODS: A systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis identified invasive brachial and aortic BP recorded in 1151 participants (62+/-12 years, 72% male). SBP amplification was calculated as brachial SBP minus aortic SBP. Hypertension classification (defined according to previously described thresholds for brachial and aortic BP) was compared between the aortic and brachial BP measures. RESULTS: There was a wide range of SBP amplification, which was similar between male and female (mean+/-SD, 8+/-9 mm Hg and 7+/-10 mm Hg, respectively) and decreased with increasing age. High SBP amplification (>15 mm Hg) was observed in 17.4% (male, 16.8% versus female, 19.5%; P=0.44), and low SBP amplification (<5 mm Hg) in 37.3% of participants (male, 37.2% versus female, 37.4%; P=0.95). The overall level of agreement between hypertension classification based on brachial and aortic BP was moderate (kappa, 0.67; P<0.001; agreement, 87.4%). Agreement in hypertension classification was 65.0%, 38.1%, and 92.7% across classifications of optimal, prehypertension, and hypertension, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In males and females there is wide variability in aortic-to-brachial SBP amplification. There were major theoretical differences in hypertension classification based on brachial versus aortic BP. This knowledge may help toward innovations for improving cuff BP measurement accuracy.},

   abstract = {Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) is the most common form of hypertension and is highly prevalent in older people. We recently showed differences between upper-arm cuff and invasive blood pressure (BP) become greater with increasing age, which could influence correct identification of ISH. This study sought to determine the difference between identification of ISH by cuff BP compared with invasive BP. Cuff BP and invasive aortic BP were measured in 1695 subjects (median 64 years, interquartile range [55-72], 68% male) from the INSPECT (Invasive Blood Pressure Consortium) database. Data were recorded during coronary angiography among 29 studies, using 21 different cuff BP devices. ISH was defined as >/=130/<80 mm Hg using cuff BP compared with invasive aortic BP as the reference. The prevalence of ISH was 24% (n=407) according to cuff BP but 38% (n=642) according to invasive aortic BP. There was fair agreement (Cohen kappa, 0.36) and 72% concordance between cuff and invasive aortic BP for identifying ISH. Among the 28% of subjects (n=471) with misclassification of ISH status by cuff BP, 20% (n=96) of the difference was due to lower cuff systolic BP compared with invasive aortic systolic BP (mean, -16.4 mm Hg [95% CI, -18.7 to -14.1]), whereas 49% (n=231) was from higher cuff diastolic BP compared with invasive aortic diastolic BP (+14.2 mm Hg [95% CI, 11.5-16.9]). In conclusion, compared with invasive BP, cuff BP fails to identify ISH in a sizeable portion of older people and demonstrates the need to improve cuff BP measurements.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To present the evidence that describes what is being measured by upper-arm cuff blood pressure (BP) and the level of accuracy compared with invasive central aortic and brachial BP. Potential causes of inaccuracy and emerging methods are also discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: On average cuff systolic BP systematically underestimates invasive brachial systolic BP, although in a given individual it may substantially under- or over-estimate central aortic systolic BP. Such errors may affect individual health management outcomes and distort population level data on hypertension prevalence and control. Oscillometric cuff BP is particularly susceptible to inaccuracy in people with high arterial stiffness and with pathophysiological BP waveform shapes. Emerging cuff-less BP methods will be susceptible to inaccuracy if oscillometric cuff BP is used for calibration. The original purpose of cuff BP was to estimate central aortic BP. Recent evidence has shown substantial inaccuracy of oscillometric cuff BP exists for the measurement of invasive central aortic and brachial BP. Thus, development of more accurate BP methods, through better understanding of oscillometric and BP waveform morphology, is needed to improve health outcomes related to high BP.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypertension (HTN) is the single greatest cardiovascular risk factor worldwide. HTN management is usually guided by brachial cuff blood pressure (BP), but questions have been raised regarding accuracy. OBJECTIVES: This comprehensive analysis determined the accuracy of cuff BP and the consequent effect on BP classification compared with intra-arterial BP reference standards. METHODS: Three individual participant data meta-analyses were conducted among studies (from the 1950s to 2016) that measured intra-arterial aortic BP, intra-arterial brachial BP, and cuff BP. RESULTS: A total of 74 studies with 3,073 participants were included. Intra-arterial brachial systolic blood pressure (SBP) was higher than aortic values (8.0 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.9 to 10.1 mm Hg; p < 0.0001) and intra-arterial brachial diastolic BP was lower than aortic values (-1.0 mm Hg; 95% CI: -2.0 to -0.1 mm Hg; p = 0.038). Cuff BP underestimated intra-arterial brachial SBP (-5.7 mm Hg; 95% CI: -8.0 to -3.5 mm Hg; p < 0.0001) but overestimated intra-arterial diastolic BP (5.5 mm Hg; 95% CI: 3.5 to 7.5 mm Hg; p < 0.0001). Cuff and intra-arterial aortic SBP showed a small mean difference (0.3 mm Hg; 95% CI: -1.5 to 2.1 mm Hg; p = 0.77) but poor agreement (mean absolute difference 8.0 mm Hg; 95% CI: 7.1 to 8.9 mm Hg). Concordance between BP classification using the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure cuff BP (normal, pre-HTN, and HTN stages 1 and 2) compared with intra-arterial brachial BP was 60%, 50%, 53%, and 80%, and using intra-arterial aortic BP was 79%, 57%, 52%, and 76%, respectively. Using revised intra-arterial thresholds based on cuff BP percentile rank, concordance between BP classification using cuff BP compared with intra-arterial brachial BP was 71%, 66%, 52%, and 76%, and using intra-arterial aortic BP was 74%, 61%, 56%, and 65%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Cuff BP has variable accuracy for measuring either brachial or aortic intra-arterial BP, and this adversely influences correct BP classification. These findings indicate that stronger accuracy standards for BP devices may improve cardiovascular risk management.},

   abstract = {Blood pressure (BP) is a leading global risk factor. Increasing age is related to changes in cardiovascular physiology that could influence cuff BP measurement, but this has never been examined systematically and was the aim of this study. Cuff BP was compared with invasive aortic BP across decades of age (from 40 to 89 years) using individual-level data from 31 studies (1674 patients undergoing coronary angiography) and 22 different cuff BP devices (19 oscillometric, 1 automated auscultation, 2 mercury sphygmomanometry) from the Invasive Blood Pressure Consortium. Subjects were aged 64+/-11 years, and 32% female. Cuff systolic BP overestimated invasive aortic systolic BP in those aged 40 to 49 years, but with each older decade of age, there was a progressive shift toward increasing underestimation of aortic systolic BP (P<0.0001). Conversely, cuff diastolic BP overestimated invasive aortic diastolic BP, and this progressively increased with increasing age (P<0.0001). Thus, there was a progressive increase in cuff pulse pressure underestimation of invasive aortic PP with increasing decades of age (P<0.0001). These age-related trends were observed across all categories of BP control. We conclude that cuff BP as an estimate of aortic BP was substantially influenced by increasing age, thus potentially exposing older people to greater chance for misdiagnosis of the true risk related to BP.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate blood pressure (BP) measurement is critical for optimal cardiovascular risk management. Age-related trajectories for cuff-measured BP accelerate faster in women compared with men, but whether cuff BP represents the intraarterial (invasive) aortic BP is unknown. This study aimed to determine the sex differences between cuff BP, invasive aortic BP, and the difference between the 2 measurements. METHODS: Upper-arm cuff BP and invasive aortic BP were measured during coronary angiography in 1615 subjects from the Invasive Blood Pressure Consortium Database. This analysis comprised 22 different cuff BP devices from 28 studies. RESULTS: Subjects were 64+/-11 years (range 40-89) and 32% women. For the same cuff systolic BP (SBP), invasive aortic SBP was 4.4 mm Hg higher in women compared with men. Cuff and invasive aortic SBP were higher in women compared with men, but the sex difference was more pronounced from invasive aortic SBP, was the lowest in younger ages, and the highest in older ages. Cuff diastolic blood pressure overestimated invasive diastolic blood pressure in both sexes. For cuff and invasive diastolic blood pressure separately, there were sex*age interactions in which diastolic blood pressure was higher in younger men and lower in older men, compared with women. Cuff pulse pressure underestimated invasive aortic pulse pressure in excess of 10 mm Hg for both sexes in older age. CONCLUSIONS: For the same cuff SBP, invasive aortic SBP was higher in women compared with men. How this translates to cardiovascular risk prediction needs to be determined, but women may be at higher BP-related risk than estimated by cuff measurements.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Given the shortage of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs in India and poor uptake worldwide, there is an urgent need to find alternative models of CR that are inexpensive and may offer choice to subgroups with poor uptake (e.g., women and elderly). OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the effects of yoga-based CR (Yoga-CaRe) on major cardiovascular events and self-rated health in a multicenter randomized controlled trial. METHODS: The trial was conducted in 24 medical centers across India. This study recruited 3,959 patients with acute myocardial infarction with a median and minimum follow-up of 22 and 6 months. Patients were individually randomized to receive either a Yoga-CaRe program (n = 1,970) or enhanced standard care involving educational advice (n = 1,989). The co-primary outcomes were: 1) first occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, or emergency cardiovascular hospitalization); and 2) self-rated health on the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Level visual analogue scale at 12 weeks. RESULTS: MACE occurred in 131 (6.7%) patients in the Yoga-CaRe group and 146 (7.4%) patients in the enhanced standard care group (hazard ratio with Yoga-CaRe: 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71 to 1.15; p = 0.41). Self-rated health was 77 in Yoga-CaRe and 75.7 in the enhanced standard care group (baseline-adjusted mean difference in favor of Yoga-CaRe: 1.5; 95% CI: 0.5 to 2.5; p = 0.002). The Yoga-CaRe group had greater return to pre-infarct activities, but there was no difference in tobacco cessation or medication adherence between the treatment groups (secondary outcomes). CONCLUSIONS: Yoga-CaRe improved self-rated health and return to pre-infarct activities after acute myocardial infarction, but the trial lacked statistical power to show a difference in MACE. Yoga-CaRe may be an option when conventional CR is unavailable or unacceptable to individuals.

   abstract = {Elderly women have increased aortic and ventricular stiffness but preserved global systolic function. Possible gender differences in ventricular deformation attributed to increased aortic stiffness at rest or with positive inotropic stress remain unknown. Eighty-four subjects (mean age: 63+/-8 years) were assessed for aortic stiffness by pulse wave velocity and ventricular deformation at rest and during dobutamine stress using magnetic resonance. At rest, women (n=40) had greater aortic stiffness and ventricular deformation than men (P<0.05). In men, dobutamine increased longitudinal (mean+/-SD: 3.3+/-4.1%; P<0.01) and circumferential deformation (2.9+/-5.1%; P=0.007), whereas women showed an increase in circumferential deformation only (4.8+/-6.3%; P<0.01). In men there was an inverse association between longitudinal deformation and pulse wave velocity at rest (r=-0.51; P=0.002) and linear at stress (r=0.52; P=0.001). In women there were no significant relations at rest, whereas at stress longitudinal deformation was inversely associated with pulse wave velocity (r=-0.43; P=0.02). We demonstrate gender-specific differences in the relationship between aortic stiffness and ventricular deformation at rest and during dobutamine stress. Although at rest longitudinal deformation is inversely related to aortic stiffness in men, there is no such relationship in women. At stress, men improve longitudinal function, whereas in women such response is limited.},

Isobaric diameter and isometric force were measured together with membrane potential in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells (SMC). Calcium in the endothelial cells and SMC was imaged with confocal microscopy. In the presence of noradrenaline and cyclopiazonic acid, ryanodine-insensitive oscillations in tone were produced. The frequency was about 1 min(-1) and amplitude about 70% of the maximal tone. The amplitude was reduced by indomethacin and increased with L-NAME. Vasomotion was inhibited by nifedipine and by 40 mM potassium. The frequency was increased and amplitude decreased by removal of the endothelium and by application of charybdotoxin and apamin. The vasomotion was associated with in-phase oscillations of membrane potential in endothelial cells and SMC and oscillations of [Ca2+]i that were in near anti-phase. We suggest a working model for the generation of oscillation based on a membrane oscillator where ion channels in both endothelial cells and SMC interact via a current running between the two cell types through myoendothelial gap junctions, which sets up a near anti-phase oscillation of [Ca2+]i in the two cell types.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Angina is common in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and is associated with abnormal myocardial perfusion. Wave intensity analysis improves the understanding of the mechanics of myocardial ischemia. OBJECTIVES: Wave intensity analysis was used to describe the mechanisms underlying perfusion abnormalities in patients with HCM. METHODS: Simultaneous pressure and flow were measured in the proximal left anterior descending artery in 33 patients with HCM and 20 control patients at rest and during hyperemia, allowing calculation of wave intensity. Patients also underwent quantitative first-pass perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance to measure myocardial perfusion reserve. RESULTS: Patients with HCM had a lower coronary flow reserve than control subjects (1.9 +/- 0.8 vs. 2.7 +/- 0.9; p = 0.01). Coronary hemodynamics in HCM were characterized by a very large backward compression wave during systole (38 +/- 11% vs. 21 +/- 6%; p < 0.001) and a proportionately smaller backward expansion wave (27% +/- 8% vs. 33 +/- 6%; p = 0.006) compared with control subjects. Patients with severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction had a bisferiens pressure waveform resulting in an additional proximally originating deceleration wave during systole. The proportion of waves acting to accelerate coronary flow increased with hyperemia, and the magnitude of change was proportional to the myocardial perfusion reserve (rho = 0.53; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Coronary flow in patients with HCM is deranged. Distally, compressive deformation of intramyocardial blood vessels during systole results in an abnormally large backward compression wave, whereas proximally, severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction is associated with an additional deceleration wave. Perfusion abnormalities in HCM are not simply a consequence of supply/demand mismatch or remodeling of the intramyocardial blood vessels; they represent a dynamic interaction with the mechanics of myocardial ischemia that may be amenable to treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Wave intensity analysis (WIA) of the coronary arteries allows description of the predominant mechanisms influencing coronary flow over the cardiac cycle. The data are traditionally derived from pressure and velocity changes measured invasively in the coronary artery. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) allows measurement of coronary velocities using phase velocity mapping and derivation of central aortic pressure from aortic distension. We assessed the feasibility of WIA of the coronary arteries using CMR and compared this to invasive data. METHODS: CMR scans were undertaken in a serial cohort of patients who had undergone invasive WIA. Velocity maps were acquired in the proximal left anterior descending and proximal right coronary artery using a retrospectively-gated breath-hold spiral phase velocity mapping sequence with high temporal resolution (19 ms). A breath-hold segmented gradient echo sequence was used to acquire through-plane cross sectional area changes in the proximal ascending aorta which were used as a surrogate of an aortic pressure waveform after calibration with brachial blood pressure measured with a sphygmomanometer. CMR-derived aortic pressures and CMR-measured velocities were used to derive wave intensity. The CMR-derived wave intensities were compared to invasive data in 12 coronary arteries (8 left, 4 right). Waves were presented as absolute values and as a % of total wave intensity. Intra-study reproducibility of invasive and non-invasive WIA was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: The combination of the CMR-derived pressure and velocity data produced the expected pattern of forward and backward compression and expansion waves. The intra-study reproducibility of the CMR derived wave intensities as a % of the total wave intensity (mean +/- standard deviation of differences) was 0.0 +/- 6.8%, ICC = 0.91. Intra-study reproducibility for the corresponding invasive data was 0.0 +/- 4.4%, ICC = 0.96. The invasive and CMR studies showed reasonable correlation (r = 0.73) with a mean difference of 0.0 +/- 11.5%. CONCLUSION: This proof of concept study demonstrated that CMR may be used to perform coronary WIA non-invasively with reasonable reproducibility compared to invasive WIA. The technique potentially allows WIA to be performed in a wider range of patients and pathologies than those who can be studied invasively.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: AV delay optimisation of biventricular pacing devices (cardiac resynchronisation therapy, CRT) is performed in trials and recommended by current guidelines. The Doppler echocardiographic iterative method is the most commonly recommended. Yet whether it can be executed reliably has never been tested formally. METHODS: 36 multinational specialists, familiar with using the echocardiographic iterative method of CRT optimisation, were shown 20-40 sets of transmitral Doppler traces at 6-8 AV settings and asked to select the optimal AV delay. Unknown to the specialists, some Doppler datasets appeared in duplicate, allowing assessment of both inter and intra-specialist interpretation. RESULTS: On the Kappa scale of agreement (1 = perfect agreement, 0 = chance alone), the agreement regarding optimal AV delay between specialists was poor (kappa=0.12 +/- 0.08). More importantly, agreement of specialists with themselves (i.e. viewing identical sets of traces, twice) was also poor, with Kappa=0.23 +/- 0.07 and mean absolute difference in optimum AV delay of 83 ms between first and second viewing of the same traces. CONCLUSION: Iterative AV optimisation is not executed reliably by experts, even in an artificially simplified context where biological variability and variation in image acquisition are eliminated by use of identical traces. This cannot be blamed on insufficient skills of some experts or discordant methods of selecting the optimum, because operators also showed poor agreement with themselves when assessing the same trace. Instead, guidelines should retract any recommendation for this algorithm. Guideline-development processes might usefully begin with a rudimentary check on proposed algorithms, to establish at least minimal credibility.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Left ventricular diastolic function as assessed by tissue Doppler echocardiography predicts cardiovascular event rates at 4 years of follow-up in patients with hypertension. Our aim was to evaluate whether this extends to predicting cardiovascular mortality after 20 years of follow-up. METHODS: Conventional (E) and tissue Doppler (e') echocardiography was performed on hypertensive participants in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) with long-term follow-up ascertained via linkage to the Office of National Statistics. Cardiovascular mortality was defined as death from coronary heart disease, stroke and other cardiovascular aetiology such as heart failure or peripheral vascular disease. Unadjusted and adjusted Cox regression survival models were constructed to investigate the association between tissue Doppler echocardiography measurements and long-term cardiovascular mortality. RESULTS: Among 506 hypertensive patients (median age 64, interquartile range (58, 69), 87% male), there were 200 (40%) deaths over a 20-year follow-up period. 60 deaths (12%) were cardiovascular-related.A reduction in e' was independently associated with increased cardiovascular mortality, after adjusting for the ACC/AHA Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) risk score, with an inverse HR of 1.22 per 1 cm/s decrease (95% CI 1.04-1.43). A higher E/e' ratio was independently associated with increased cardiovascular mortality, after adjusting for the ASCVD risk score, with an HR of 1.12 per 1-unit increase (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.23). CONCLUSIONS: Impaired left ventricular diastolic function, measured using tissue Doppler echocardiography through e' and E/e', independently predicts increased cardiovascular mortality over 20 years in hypertensive patients, highlighting its long-term prognostic significance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vascular smooth muscle cell (VMSC) proliferation is an essential component of myointimal hyperplasia, which is implicated in the failure of 30% to 50% of vascular interventions, such as coronary angioplasty and peripheral vein grafting. We have shown that cells derived from stenotic lesions in infrainguinal vein grafts were significantly more resistant than controls to growth inhibition by heparin. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a prospective study, we correlated antiproliferative responses to heparin in vitro with graft patency after 1 year. Sixty-two patients with infrainguinal vein grafts were entered into a graft surveillance program for > or = 1 year. At operation, saphenous vein segments were explanted for VSMC culture. Cell proliferation in response to fetal calf serum was later determined in the presence and absence of heparin. In 35 cell cultures, including 13 from the above-mentioned patients, [3H]heparin binding was also estimated. VSMCs from patients with patent grafts were significantly more sensitive to growth inhibition by heparin than cells from patients with stenoses (median, 54% versus 20.9%, P<0.001), and [3H]heparin binding was strongly correlated with inhibition of proliferation (r=0.81). CONCLUSIONS: Responsiveness to heparin in cultured VSMCs is a strong predictor of outcome for infrainguinal vein grafts, and reduced sensitivity to heparin is correlated with decreased heparin binding. Relative resistance to the antiproliferative action of heparin may be a marker for aberrant regulation of VSMC growth.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low socio-economic position (SEP) is a risk factor for multiple health outcomes, but its molecular imprints in the body remain unclear. METHODS: We examined SEP as a determinant of serum nuclear magnetic resonance metabolic profiles in approximately 30 000 adults and 4000 children across 10 UK and Finnish cohort studies. RESULTS: In risk-factor-adjusted analysis of 233 metabolic measures, low educational attainment was associated with 37 measures including higher levels of triglycerides in small high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and lower levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), omega-3 fatty acids, apolipoprotein A1, large and very large HDL particles (including levels of their respective lipid constituents) and cholesterol measures across different density lipoproteins. Among adults whose father worked in manual occupations, associations with apolipoprotein A1, large and very large HDL particles and HDL-2 cholesterol remained after adjustment for SEP in later life. Among manual workers, levels of glutamine were higher compared with non-manual workers. All three indicators of low SEP were associated with lower DHA, omega-3 fatty acids and HDL diameter. At all ages, children of manual workers had lower levels of DHA as a proportion of total fatty acids. CONCLUSIONS: Our work indicates that social and economic factors have a measurable impact on human physiology. Lower SEP was independently associated with a generally unfavourable metabolic profile, consistent across ages and cohorts. The metabolites we found to be associated with SEP, including DHA, are known to predict cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline in later life and may contribute to health inequalities.},

We examined if altered expression of p53 protein might be related to this phenomenon. HVSMC were cultured from saphenous vein and p53 protein levels examined using immunocytochemistry, and by immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific for wild-type or mutant conformations followed by SDS PAGE and immunoblotting. Inhibition of proliferation by heparin was measured in 14-day growth assays. Elevated levels of p53 were found in five out of 41 HVSMC strains. The accumulated p53 protein was not precipitated by a mutant conformation-specific anti-p53 antibody in any of the five strains. In one of the five positive strains there was concomitant human cytomegaloviral infection. No significant difference was found between efficacy of heparin in the p53-positive and -negative strains. Furthermore heparin had no detectable effect on p53 protein levels. Although aberrant levels of p53 are detectable in a minority of HVSMC strains, these data do not support a role for altered p53 expression in resistance to the growth inhibitory effects of heparin in these cells.},

   abstract = {Development of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors for coronary heart disease (CHD) has yet to deliver licensed medicines. To distinguish compound from drug target failure, we compared evidence from clinical trials and drug target Mendelian randomization of CETP protein concentration, comparing this to Mendelian randomization of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). We show that previous failures of CETP inhibitors are likely compound related, as illustrated by significant degrees of between-compound heterogeneity in effects on lipids, blood pressure, and clinical outcomes observed in trials. On-target CETP inhibition, assessed through Mendelian randomization, is expected to reduce the risk of CHD, heart failure, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease, while increasing the risk of age-related macular degeneration. In contrast, lower PCSK9 concentration is anticipated to decrease the risk of CHD, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, multiple sclerosis, and stroke, while potentially increasing the risk of Alzheimer's disease and asthma. Due to distinct effects on lipoprotein metabolite profiles, joint inhibition of CETP and PCSK9 may provide added benefit. In conclusion, we provide genetic evidence that CETP is an effective target for CHD prevention but with a potential on-target adverse effect on age-related macular degeneration.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Higher concentrations of cholesterol-containing low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The association of LDL-C with non-CVD traits remains unclear, as are the possible independent contributions of other cholesterol-containing lipoproteins and apolipoproteins. METHODS: Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to measure the cholesterol content of high density (HDL-C), very low-density (VLDL-C), intermediate-density (IDL-C), as well as low-density lipoprotein fractions, the apolipoproteins Apo-A1 and Apo-B, as well as total triglycerides (TG), remnant-cholesterol (Rem-Chol) and total cholesterol (TC). The causal effects of these exposures were assessed against 33 outcomes using univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR). RESULTS: The majority of cholesterol containing lipoproteins and apolipoproteins affect coronary heart disease (CHD), carotid intima-media thickness, carotid plaque, C-reactive protein (CRP) and blood pressure. Multivariable MR indicated that many of these effects act independently of HDL-C, LDL-C and TG, the most frequently measured lipid fractions. Higher concentrations of TG, VLDL-C, Rem-Chol and Apo-B increased heart failure (HF) risk; often independently of LDL-C, HDL-C or TG. Finally, a subset of these exposures associated with non-CVD traits such as Alzheimer's disease (AD: HDL-C, LDL-C, IDL-C, Apo-B), type 2 diabetes (T2DM: VLDL-C, IDL-C, LDL-C), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD: LDL-C, IDL-C). CONCLUSIONS: The cholesterol content of a wide range of lipoprotein and apolipoproteins associate with measures of atherosclerosis, blood pressure, CRP, and CHD, with a subset affecting HF, T2DM, AD and IBD risk. Many of the observed effects appear to act independently of LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG, supporting the targeting of lipid fractions beyond LDL-C for disease prevention.
It is known that increases in the amount of certain fats and proteins in the blood can lead to heart attacks. These increases are also found in people with other diseases. Here, we looked at inherited differences in some fats and proteins in blood to explore whether these could be associated with various diseases. We found that some fats and proteins in blood were associated with heart disease (including heart failure), blood pressure, blockages in blood vessels, and to a lesser extent with diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. These findings suggest that changes to lipids and proteins in the blood might lead to various diseases, including some that are not normally associated with changes in the blood. Monitoring these changes could improve diagnosis and treatment of these diseases.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Aortic reservoir pressure indices independently predict cardiovascular events and mortality. Despite this, there has never been a study in humans to determine whether the theoretical principles of the mathematically derived aortic reservoir pressure (RP(derived)) and excess pressure (XP(derived)) model have a real physiological basis. This study aimed to directly measure the aortic reservoir (AR(direct); by cyclic change in aortic volume) and determine its relationship with RP(derived), XP(derived), and aortic blood pressure (BP). APPROACH AND RESULTS: Ascending aortic BP and Doppler flow velocity were recorded via intra-arterial wire in 10 men (aged 62 +/- 12 years) during coronary artery bypass surgery. Simultaneous ascending aortic transesophageal echocardiography was used to measure AR(direct). Published mathematical formulae were used to determine RP(derived) and XP(derived). AR(direct) was strongly and linearly related to RP(derived) during systole (r=0.988; P<0.001) and diastole (r=0.985; P<0.001). Peak cross-correlation (r=0.98) occurred at a phase lag of 0.004 s into the cardiac cycle, suggesting close temporal agreement between waveforms. The relationship between aortic BP and AR(direct) was qualitatively similar to the cyclic relationship between aortic BP and RP(derived), with peak cross-correlations occurring at identical phase lags (AR(direct) versus aortic BP, r=0.96 at 0.06 s; RP(derived) versus aortic BP, r=0.98 at 0.06 s). CONCLUSIONS: RP(derived) is highly correlated with changes in proximal aortic volume, consistent with its physiological interpretation as corresponding to the instantaneous volume of blood stored in the aorta. Thus, aortic reservoir pressure should be considered in the interpretation of the central BP waveform.},

   abstract = {Exercise hypertension independently predicts cardiovascular mortality, although little is known about exercise central hemodynamics. This study aimed to determine the contribution of arterial wave travel and aortic reservoir characteristics to central blood pressure (BP) during exercise. We hypothesized that exercise central BP would be principally related to forward wave travel and aortic reservoir function. After routine diagnostic coronary angiography, invasive pressure and flow velocity were recorded in the ascending aorta via sensor-tipped intra-arterial wires in 10 participants (age, 55+/-10 years; 70% men) free of coronary artery disease with normal left ventricular function. Measures were recorded at baseline and during supine cycle ergometry. Using wave intensity analysis, dominant wave types throughout the cardiac cycle were identified (forward and backward, compression, and decompression), and aortic reservoir and excess pressure were calculated. Central systolic BP increased significantly with exercise (Delta=19+/-12 mm Hg; P<0.001). This was associated with increases in systolic forward compression waves (Delta=12x10(6)+/-17x10(6) W.m(-2).s(-1); P=0.045) and forward decompression waves in late systole (Delta=9x10(6)+/-6x10(6) W.m(-2).s(-1); P<0.001). Despite significant augmentation in BP (Delta=9+/-6 mm Hg; P=0.002), reflected waves did not increase in magnitude (Delta=-1x10(6)+/-3x10(6) W.m(-2).s(-1); P=0.2). Excess pressure rose significantly with exercise (Delta=16+/-9 mm Hg; P<0.001), and reservoir pressure integral fell (Delta=-5x10(5)+/-5x10(5) Pa.s; P=0.010). Change in reflection coefficient negatively correlated with change in central systolic BP (r=-0.68; P=0.03). We conclude that elevation of exercise central BP is principally because of increases in aortic forward traveling waves generated by left ventricular ejection. These findings have relevance to understanding central BP waveform morphology and pathophysiology of exercise hypertension.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Central augmentation pressure (AP) and index (AIx) predict cardiovascular events and mortality, but underlying physiological mechanisms remain disputed. Whilst traditionally believed to relate to wave-reflections arising from proximal arterial impedance (and stiffness) mismatching, recent evidence suggests aortic reservoir function may be a more dominant contributor to AP and AIx. Our aim was therefore to determine relationships between aortic-brachial stiffness mismatching, AP, AIx, aortic reservoir function and end-organ disease. METHODS: Aortic (aPWV) and brachial (bPWV) pulse wave velocity were measured in 359 individuals (aged 61+/-9, 49% male). Central AP, AIx and aortic reservoir indices were derived from radial tonometry. Participants were stratified by positive (bPWV>aPWV), negligible (bPWV approximately aPWV) or negative stiffness mismatch (bPWV<aPWV). Left-ventricular mass index (LVMI) was measured by 2D-echocardiography. RESULTS: Central AP and AIx were higher with negative stiffness mismatch vs. negligible or positive stiffness mismatch (11+/-6 vs. 10+/-6 vs. 8+/-6mmHg, p<0.001 and 24+/-10 vs. 24+/-11 vs. 21+/-13%, p=0.042). Stiffness mismatch (bPWV-aPWV) was negatively associated with AP (r=-0.18,p=0.001), but not AIx (r=-0.06,p=0.27). Aortic reservoir pressure strongly correlated to AP (r=0.81,p<0.001) and AIx (r=0.62,p<0.001) independent of age, sex, heart rate, mean arterial pressure and height (standardized beta=0.61 and 0.12,p</=0.001). Aortic reservoir pressure independently predicted abnormal LVMI (beta=0.13, p=0.024). CONCLUSION: Positive aortic-brachial stiffness mismatch does not result in higher AP or AIx. Aortic reservoir function, rather than discrete wave-reflection from proximal arterial stiffness mismatching provides a better model description of AP and AIx, and also has clinical relevance as evidenced by an independent association of aortic reservoir pressure with LVMI.},

Irrespective of resting BP, some individuals may experience exaggerated rise in systolic BP with exercise, which in adulthood is associated with risk of hypertension, and cardiovascular (CV) disease. It is unknown if exercise BP is associated with markers of CV structure during adolescence. We examined this question in a large adolescent cohort taking account of the possible confounding effect of body composition and BP status. METHODS: 4036 adolescents (mean age 17.8+/-0.4years, 45% male), part of a UK population-based birth cohort study completed a sub-maximal step-test with BP immediately post-exercise. Sub-samples underwent comprehensive echocardiography for assessment of cardiac structure; arterial structure including aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and carotid intima-media thickness; and assessment of body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). RESULTS: Each 5mmHg higher post-exercise systolic BP was associated with CV structure, including 0.38g/m(2.7) (95% CI: 0.29, 0.47) greater left-ventricular mass index (LVMI), and 0.04m/s (95% CI: 0.03, 0.04) greater aortic PWV. Adjustment for age, total body fat, lean mass and BP status attenuated, but did not abolish associations with LVMI (0.14g/m(2.7) per 5mmHg of post-exercise systolic BP; 95% CI 0.21, 0.39) or aortic PWV (0.03m/s per 5mmHg of post-exercise systolic BP; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.04). CONCLUSION: Submaximal exercise systolic BP is associated with markers of CV structure in adolescents. Given the clinical relevance of exercise BP in adulthood, such associations may have implications for CV disease screening in young people and risk in later life.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine if adenosine administration is required for the pressure-only assessment of coronary stenoses. BACKGROUND: The instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) is a vasodilator-free pressure-only measure of the hemodynamic severity of a coronary stenosis comparable to fractional flow reserve (FFR) in diagnostic categorization. In this study, we used hyperemic stenosis resistance (HSR), a combined pressure-and-flow index, as an arbiter to determine when iFR and FFR disagree which index is most representative of the hemodynamic significance of the stenosis. We then test whether administering adenosine significantly improves diagnostic performance of iFR. METHODS: In 51 vessels, intracoronary pressure and flow velocity was measured distal to the stenosis at rest and during adenosine-mediated hyperemia. The iFR (at rest and during adenosine administration [iFRa]), FFR, HSR, baseline, and hyperemic microvascular resistance were calculated using automated algorithms. RESULTS: When iFR and FFR disagreed (4 cases, or 7.7% of the study population), HSR agreed with iFR in 50% of cases and with FFR in 50% of cases. Differences in magnitude of microvascular resistance did not influence diagnostic categorization; iFR, iFRa, and FFR had equally good diagnostic agreement with HSR (receiver-operating characteristic area under the curve 0.93 iFR vs. 0.94 iFRa and 0.96 FFR, p = 0.48). CONCLUSIONS: iFR and FFR had equivalent agreement with classification of coronary stenosis severity by HSR. Further reduction in resistance by the administration of adenosine did not improve diagnostic categorization, indicating that iFR can be used as an adenosine-free alternative to FFR.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Meta-analysis of registries (comparative effectiveness research) shows that primary angioplasty and fibrinolysis have equivalent real-world survival. Yet, randomized, controlled trials consistently find primary angioplasty superior. Can unequal allocation of higher-risk patients in registries have masked primary angioplasty benefit? METHODS AND RESULTS: First, we constructed a model to demonstrate the potential effect of allocation bias. We then analyzed published registries (55022 patients) for allocation of higher-risk patients (Killip class >/=1) to determine whether the choice of reperfusion therapy was affected by the risk level of the patient. Meta-regression was used to examine the relationship between differences in allocation of high-risk patient to primary angioplasty or fibrinolysis and mortality. Initial modeling suggested that registry outcomes are sensitive to allocation bias of high-risk patients. Across the registries, the therapy receiving excess high-risk patients had worse mortality. Unequal distribution of high-risk status accounted for most of the between-registry variance (adjusted R(2)(meta)=83.1%). Accounting for differential allocation of higher-risk patients, primary angioplasty gave 22% lower mortality (odds ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.97; P=0.029). We derive a formula, called the number needed to abolish, highlighting situations in which comparative effectiveness studies are particularly vulnerable to this bias. CONCLUSIONS: In ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, clinicians' preference for management of a few high-risk patients can shift mortality substantially. Comparative effectiveness research in any disease is vulnerable to this, especially diseases with an immediately identifiable high-risk subgroup that clinicians prefer to allocate to 1 therapy. For this reason, preliminary indications from registry-based comparative effectiveness research should be definitively tested by randomized, controlled trials.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to develop an adenosine-independent, pressure-derived index of coronary stenosis severity. BACKGROUND: Assessment of stenosis severity with fractional flow reserve (FFR) requires that coronary resistance is stable and minimized. This is usually achieved by administration of pharmacological agents such as adenosine. In this 2-part study, we determine whether there is a time when resistance is naturally minimized at rest and assess the diagnostic efficiency, compared with FFR, of a new pressure-derived adenosine-free index of stenosis severity over that time. METHODS: A total of 157 stenoses were assessed. In part 1 (39 stenoses), intracoronary pressure and flow velocity were measured distal to the stenosis; in part 2 (118 stenoses), intracoronary pressure alone was measured. Measurements were made at baseline and under pharmacologic vasodilation with adenosine. RESULTS: Wave-intensity analysis identified a wave-free period in which intracoronary resistance at rest is similar in variability and magnitude (coefficient of variation: 0.08 +/- 0.06 and 284 +/- 147 mm Hg s/m) to those during FFR (coefficient of variation: 0.08 +/- 0.06 and 302 +/- 315 mm Hg s/m; p = NS for both). The resting distal-to-proximal pressure ratio during this period, the instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR), correlated closely with FFR (r = 0.9, p < 0.001) with excellent diagnostic efficiency (receiver-operating characteristic area under the curve of 93%, at FFR <0.8), specificity, sensitivity, negative and positive predictive values of 91%, 85%, 85%, and 91%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Intracoronary resistance is naturally constant and minimized during the wave-free period. The instantaneous wave-free ratio calculated over this period produces a drug-free index of stenosis severity comparable to FFR. (Vasodilator Free Measure of Fractional Flow Reserve [ADVISE]; NCT01118481).},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to explore the prognostic significance of PTT and PBVi using an automated, inline method of estimation using CMR. BACKGROUND: Pulmonary transit time (PTT) and pulmonary blood volume index (PBVi) (the product of PTT and cardiac index), are quantitative biomarkers of cardiopulmonary status. The development of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) quantitative perfusion mapping permits their automated derivation, facilitating clinical adoption. METHODS: In this retrospective 2-center study of patients referred for clinical myocardial perfusion assessment using CMR, analysis of right and left ventricular cavity arterial input function curves from first pass perfusion was performed automatically (incorporating artificial intelligence techniques), allowing estimation of PTT and subsequent derivation of PBVi. Association with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and all-cause mortality were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard models, after adjusting for comorbidities and CMR parameters. RESULTS: A total of 985 patients (67% men, median age 62 years [interquartile range (IQR): 52 to 71 years]) were included, with median left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 62% (IQR: 54% to 69%). PTT increased with age, male sex, atrial fibrillation, and left atrial area, and reduced with LVEF, heart rate, diabetes, and hypertension (model r(2) = 0.57). Over a median follow-up period of 28.6 months (IQR: 22.6 to 35.7 months), MACE occurred in 61 (6.2%) patients. After adjusting for prognostic factors, both PTT and PBVi independently predicted MACE, but not all-cause mortality. There was no association between cardiac index and MACE. For every 1 x SD (2.39-s) increase in PTT, the adjusted hazard ratio for MACE was 1.43 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10 to 1.85; p = 0.007). The adjusted hazard ratio for 1 x SD (118 ml/m(2)) increase in PBVi was 1.42 (95% CI: 1.13 to 1.78; p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary transit time (and its derived parameter pulmonary blood volume index), measured automatically without user interaction as part of CMR perfusion mapping, independently predicted adverse cardiovascular outcomes. These biomarkers may offer additional insights into cardiopulmonary function beyond conventional predictors including ejection fraction.},

   abstract = {AIMS: We tested whether on-statin C-reactive protein is associated with cardiovascular (CV) outcome in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT). METHODS AND RESULTS: ASCOT randomized a subset of 4853 patients with total cholesterol </=6.5 mmol/L (250 mg/dL) to atorvastatin or placebo. In a case-control study during 5.5-year follow-up, 485 CV cases were age- and sex-matched with 1367 controls. Baseline LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) and log-transformed C-reactive protein predicted CV events [odds ratio (OR) per 1 standard deviation (SD) 1.31 (95% confidence interval {CI}: 1.10, 1.56), P = 0.002 and OR 1.19 (1.05, 1.34), P = 0.006, respectively]. Including baseline C-reactive protein into a Framingham risk model very modestly improved risk prediction. Baseline C-reactive protein did not indicate the magnitude of the atorvastatin effect on CV outcome (P = 0.54). At 6 months, atorvastatin reduced median LDL-c by 40.3% and median C-reactive protein by 27.4%. In those randomized to atorvastatin, lower on-treatment LDL-c at 6 months was associated with a significant reduction in subsequent CV events [OR 0.41 (0.22, 0.75), P = 0.004] comparing those above and below the median (2.1 mmol/L). In contrast, C-reactive protein below the median (1.83 mg/L) compared with C-reactive protein above the median was not associated with a significant reduction in CV events [OR 0.86 (0.49, 1.51), P = 0.60]. Consequently, addition of on-treatment C-reactive protein to LDL-c did not improve prediction of statin efficacy. CONCLUSION: Among these hypertensive patients selected on the basis of traditional CV risk factors, C-reactive protein did not usefully improve the prediction of CV events and, critically, reduction in C-reactive protein associated with statin therapy was not a predictor of CV outcome alone or in combination with LDL-c.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine whether baseline and on-statin C-reactive protein (CRP) are independent predictors of cardiovascular (CV) outcome beyond low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). BACKGROUND: Use of CRP as a predictor of statin treatment remains controversial. METHODS: We investigated the relationship of baseline and on-treatment CRP with subsequent CV events in Cox models using a subset of white subjects with no history of CV disease from the UK ASCOT (Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial). RESULTS: During 5.5 years of follow-up, a total of 488 subjects experienced a CV event. CV risk increased with baseline CRP (hazard ratio [HR] per 1 SD: 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09 to 1.33) in an adjusted model. In ASCOT Lipid-Lowering Arm, the relative statin effect in preventing CV events did not differ according to tertiles of baseline CRP (p = 0.69). After 6 months of atorvastatin therapy, the median LDL-C and CRP were reduced by 38.7% and 25.8%, respectively. Those who achieved LDL-C below the median had a reduced CV risk (HR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.97) compared with those who did not. In contrast, those who achieved a CRP level below the median did not have a reduced risk of CV events (HR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.59 to 1.55). Among those who achieved LDL-C below the median, there was no difference in CV risk whether they also achieved a CRP level below (HR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.30 to 1.02) or above the median (HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.30 to 1.03). CONCLUSIONS: In these primary prevention patients, although baseline CRP independently predicted CV event risk, the achieved CRP level on while statin therapy did not predict CV events, either alone or in combination with LDL-C.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biomass smoke at higher concentrations is associated with respiratory symptoms and, after years of exposure, increased risk of respiratory disorders in adults, but its effects on cardiovascular diseases are not well characterized, particularly compared with other pollution sources like tobacco smoke or traffic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study and enrolled 25 women living in rural Sichuan, China. We measured integrated 24-h personal exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon, and measured PM2.5 and black carbon in their kitchens. We assessed participants' brachial and central blood pressure and arterial stiffness using pulse wave analysis, and analyzed dried blood spot and buccal cell samples for C-reactive protein and relative telomere length. We also evaluated the difference in these physiological and biomarker measures between individuals with high (>/=median) versus low (<median) PM2.5 exposure using multivariate regression. RESULTS: Geometric mean 24-h PM2.5 and black carbon exposures were 61 microg/m(3) (95% CI: 48, 78) and 3.2 microg/m(3) (95% CI: 2.3, 4.5), respectively. Average kitchen PM2.5 and black carbon concentrations were only moderately correlated with personal exposures (PM2.5: r=0.41; black carbon: r=0.63), although they had similar means. Women in the high and low exposure groups were similar in age, obesity, socioeconomic status, salt intake, and physical activity. Women in the high PM2.5 exposure group had higher mean brachial systolic blood pressure (SBP; difference=4.6 mmHg, 95% CI -7.8, 16.9), central SBP (difference=3.1 mmHg, 95% CI: -8.4, 14.5), central pulse pressure (difference=4.1 mmHg; 95% CI: -4.2, 12.4), and augmentation index (difference=2.8%, 95% CI: -1.6, 7.2). High exposed women had 43% shorter telomere length (95% CI: -113, 28) than that of women in the low exposure group. There were no differences in pulse wave velocity or C-reactive protein between the two exposure groups. None of the results was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that it is feasible to measure markers of vascular function and biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress in field studies of biomass smoke. Although many of the associations were in the expected direction, larger studies would be needed to establish the effects.},

   abstract = {Brachial cuff blood pressure (BP) is clinically important, but may be an inaccurate substitute for central BP. Many non-invasive devices have been developed that purport to estimate central BP from peripheral artery sites, yet with no standardized guidelines; the accuracy testing of these new devices has not been undertaken in a uniform fashion with comparable protocols. This is an abridged paper describing the recommendations reached by an international task force convened to identify issues that need to be addressed and reach consensus relating to methods for assessing and reporting the accuracy (validation) of central BP devices. The recommendations are endorsed by the Association for Research into Arterial Structure and Physiology (ARTERY) Society, as well as the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) Working Group on Arterial Structure and Function, and the ESH Working Group on Blood Pressure Monitoring and Cardiovascular Variability.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether diastolic function differs between hypertensive patients of African-Caribbean or white European origin and established whether differences could be explained by confounding variables. BACKGROUND: African Caribbeans are known to have a higher prevalence of heart failure than white Europeans but it is unclear whether this is a result of known risk factors. Tissue Doppler technology now allows accurate quantification of diastolic function, which is recognized as an important factor in the development of heart failure. METHODS: Participants from a single center participating in the ASCOT (Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial), composed of patients with hypertension but no evidence of heart failure, were studied. Left ventricular structure and function were measured in 509 patients using conventional and tissue Doppler echocardiography. Diastolic function was assessed using the tissue Doppler early diastolic velocity E' (averaged from 3 left ventricular segments) and the ratio of this and the transmitral early filling velocity E (E/E'). RESULTS: In African-Caribbean patients, mean E' was significantly lower (7.7 cm/s vs. 8.6 cm/s, p = 0.003) and mean E/E' was significantly higher (8.85 vs. 7.93, p = 0.003). After adjustment for confounding variables-age, gender, systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, cholesterol, smoking, ejection fraction, left ventricular mass index, and diabetes mellitus-the effect of African-Caribbean ethnicity on diastolic function remained highly significant (E': 7.52 vs. 8.51; p < 0.001; E/E': 8.89 vs. 7.93; p = 0.003; African Caribbeans vs. white Europeans for both comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: Diastolic function is significantly worse in hypertensive patients of African-Caribbean origin than in white Europeans. This difference in diastolic performance is not due to known confounding variables.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Optimization of cardiac resynchronization therapy using non-invasive haemodynamic parameters produces reliable optima when performed at high atrial paced heart rates. Here we investigate whether this is a result of increased heart rate or atrial pacing itself. APPROACH: Forty-three patients with cardiac resynchronization therapy underwent haemodynamic optimization of atrioventricular (AV) delay using non-invasive beat-to-beat systolic blood pressure in three states: rest (atrial-sensing, 66 +/- 11 bpm), slow atrial pacing (73 +/- 12 bpm), and fast atrial pacing (94 +/- 10 bpm). A 20-patient subset underwent a fourth optimization, during exercise (80 +/- 11 bpm). MAIN RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC, quantifying information content mean +/-SE) was 0.20 +/- 0.02 for resting sensed optimization, 0.45 +/- 0.03 for slow atrial pacing (p < 0.0001 versus rest-sensed), and 0.52 +/- 0.03 for fast atrial pacing (p = 0.12 versus slow-paced). 78% of the increase in ICC, from sinus rhythm to fast atrial pacing, is achieved by simply atrially pacing just above sinus rate. Atrial pacing increased signal (blood pressure difference between best and worst AV delay) from 6.5 +/- 0.6 mmHg at rest to 13.3 +/- 1.1 mmHg during slow atrial pacing (p < 0.0001) and 17.2 +/- 1.3 mmHg during fast atrial pacing (p = 0.003 versus slow atrial pacing). Atrial pacing reduced noise (average SD of systolic blood pressure measurements) from 4.9 +/- 0.4 mmHg at rest to 4.1 +/- 0.3 mmHg during slow atrial pacing (p = 0.28). At faster atrial pacing the noise was 4.6 +/- 0.3 mmHg (p = 0.69 versus slow-paced, p = 0.90 versus rest-sensed). In the exercise subgroup ICC was 0.14 +/- 0.02 (p = 0.97 versus rest-sensed). SIGNIFICANCE: Atrial pacing, rather than the increase in heart rate, contributes to ~80% of the observed information content improvement from sinus rhythm to fast atrial pacing. This is predominantly through increase in measured signal.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Patients with controlled hypertension are at risk of future cardiac events, but predicting first events remains difficult. We hypothesized that modern echocardiographic measures of left ventricular diastolic function may be more sensitive than traditional echocardiographic methods of risk prediction and set out to test this in a cohort of patients with well-controlled hypertension. METHODS AND RESULTS: Conventional and tissue Doppler echocardiography was performed on 980 participants in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT). All subjects had hypertension, but no known cardiac disease. Cardiac events were defined as fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (including silent myocardial infarction), coronary revascularization procedures, new-onset angina (stable or unstable), fatal and non-fatal heart failure, and life-threatening arrhythmias. Analysis was performed by a single, blinded observer. There were 56 primary cardiac events during 4.2 +/- 0.7 years follow-up. The ratio of transmitral Doppler early filling velocity to tissue Doppler early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E/E') was the strongest predictor of first cardiac events in Cox-proportional hazards models. Following adjustment for covariates, a unit rise in the E/E' ratio was associated with a 17% increment in risk of a cardiac event (HR 1.17, CI 1.05-1.29; P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Tissue Doppler E/E', a non-invasive estimate of left atrial filling pressure, independently predicts primary cardiac events in a hypertensive population and out-performed traditional echocardiographic measures in this moderately sized, well-treated hypertensive population. E/E' represents a simple, effective tool for assessing cardiac risk in a hypertensive population.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Stroke is elevated in people of black African descent, but evidence for excess subclinical cerebrovascular disease is conflicting, and the role of risk factors in determining any ethnic differences observed unexplored. METHODS: We compared prevalence of brain infarcts, and severe white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on cerebral MRI, in a community-based sample of men and women aged 58-86 of African Caribbean (214) and European (605) descent, in London, UK. Resting, central and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) were measured; diabetes was assessed by blood testing and questionnaire. RESULTS: Mean age was 70. Multiple (>/=4) brain infarcts and severe WMH occurred more frequently in African Caribbeans (18/43%), than Europeans (7/33%, P=0.05/0.008). Separately, clinic and night-time ambulatory BP were significantly associated with severe WMH in both ethnic groups; when both were entered into the model, the association for clinic SBP was attenuated and lost statistical significance [1.00 (0.98-1.02) P=0.9 in Europeans, 1.00 (0.97-1.04) P=0.9 in African Caribbeans], whereas the association for night-time SBP was retained [1.04 (1.02-1.07) P<0.001 in Europeans, 1.08 (1.03-1.12), P=0.001 in African Caribbeans]. The greater age-adjusted and sex-adjusted risk of severe WMH in African Caribbeans compared with Europeans [2.08 (1.15-3.76) P=0.02], was attenuated to 1.45 [(0.74-2.83) P=0.3] on adjustment for clinic and night-time systolic pressure, antihypertensive medication use and glycated haemoglobin. CONCLUSION: African Caribbeans have a greater burden of subclinical cerebrovascular disease than Europeans. This excess is related to elevated clinic and ambulatory BP, and to hyperglycaemia.},

These macrocycles predictably self-assemble into columnar structures via strong urea-urea hydrogen bonds and pi-stacking interactions. We developed a facile synthetic route to these macrocyclic ureas, confirmed their self-assembly pattern, and are now assessing their potential as a supramolecular building block. A series of bis-urea macrocycles were synthesized and assembled to verify the fidelity of their self-assembly motifs. Ultimately, a large phenylether bis-urea macrocycle was synthesized that formed tubular assemblies containing a guest accessible channel. We have characterized the structure of the assembled nanotubes by NMR and X-ray crystallography and evaluated this new porous solid with respect to its binding properties and specificity. This porous self-assembled material is thermally and chemically stable and can reversibly bind and exchange a variety of guest molecules.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death. Current diagnosis emphasizes the detection of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) using a fixed threshold of >/=15-mm maximum wall thickness (MWT). This study proposes a method that considers individual demographics to adjust LVH thresholds as an alternative to a 1-size-fits-all approach. METHODS: Left ventricular MWT was measured in 3 cohorts: a Reference Cohort of healthy adults (n = 5,067, no comorbidities), a Population Cohort (n = 43,239, with comorbidities), and an HCM Cohort from 6 international centers (n = 2,424). Measurement used cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and a validated artificial intelligence algorithm. The Reference Cohort was used to developed demographically adjusted LVH thresholds, and individualized z-scores based on age, sex, and body surface area (BSA), which were used to explore the other cohorts. RESULTS: The traditional >/=15-mm threshold classified 4.3% (n = 1,854) of the Population Cohort as hypertrophic, with a significant sex skew (89% male). Demographic-adjusted LVH thresholds (range: 10-17 mm) reduced ascertainment to 2.2% (n = 945), reducing the sex skew (56% male). Similar reductions in bias with height, weight, and age also occurred. The HCM cohort was found to have a 2:1 male-to-female ratio. A significant proportion of patients received diagnoses of HCM despite having MWT below the traditional LVH threshold (<15 mm): 27% of female individuals and 18% of male individuals. Using demographic-adjusted LVH thresholds reduced these proportions to 7% of female individuals and 15% of male individuals (P < 0.0001). Female patients had lower absolute MWT (18 mm vs 19 mm; P < 0.001) but higher MWT z-scores (5.1 vs 4.5; P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Age, sex, and body size influence the normal heart MWT. Using a fixed LVH threshold >/=15 mm biases LVH ascertainment in both population and HCM cohorts. A demographic-adjusted approach for LVH improves ascertainment and diagnostic accuracy.},

   abstract = {The retinal vasculature is an accessible region of the microcirculation in humans which undergoes change in essential hypertension. In this study we have examined the effect of nifedipine and glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) on retinal blood flow velocities. Retinal blood flow was measured in 11 subjects using colour Doppler ultrasound. Nifedipine (10 mg orally) or glyceryl trinitrate (0.3 mg, GTN) was given after 30 minutes recumbancy. Systolic retinal arterial blood flow velocity (SRV), diastolic retinal arterial blood flow velocity (DRV), retinal resistive index (RI), SBP, DBP were measured at -10, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 minutes following drug administration. Nifedipine significantly increased SRV (peak effect at 15 minutes) but by 25 minutes SRV did not differ significantly from pre-drug values. Nifedipine did not significantly affect DRV, RI, SBP or DBP. GTN significantly increased both SRV and DRV, although both tended to fall towards pre-drug values by 25 minutes. RI, SBP nor DBP were not significantly altered by GTN. Both nifedipine and GTN transiently increase blood flow velocity in the central retinal artery although at the doses used neither agent affected BP or RI. Doppler ultrasound measurement of retinal arterial blood velocity may be a useful technique in the investigation of the retinal microcirculation in essential hypertension.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 517 adults (58% male, aged 50-84 years) were recruited into a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial substudy and randomized to receive, for 1.1 years (median; range: 0.9-1.5 years), either (1) vitamin D3 200 000 IU (initial dose) followed 1 month later by monthly 100 000-IU doses (n=256) or (2) placebo monthly (n=261). At baseline (n=517) and follow-up (n=380), suprasystolic oscillometry was undertaken, yielding aortic BP waveforms and hemodynamic parameters. Mean deseasonalized 25-hydroxyvitamin D increased from 66 nmol/L (SD: 24) at baseline to 122 nmol/L (SD: 42) at follow-up in the vitamin D group, with no change in the placebo group. Despite small, nonsignificant changes in hemodynamic parameters in the total sample (primary outcome), we observed consistently favorable changes among the 150 participants with vitamin D deficiency (<50 nmol/L) at baseline. In this subgroup, mean changes in the vitamin D group (n=71) versus placebo group (n=79) were -5.3 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI], -11.8 to 1.3) for brachial systolic BP (P=0.11), -2.8 mm Hg (95% CI, -6.2 to 0.7) for brachial diastolic BP (P=0.12), -7.5 mm Hg (95% CI, -14.4 to -0.6) for aortic systolic BP (P=0.03), -5.7 mm Hg (95% CI, -10.8 to -0.6) for augmentation index (P=0.03), -0.3 m/s (95% CI, -0.6 to -0.1) for pulse wave velocity (P=0.02), -8.6 mm Hg (95% CI, -15.4 to -1.9) for peak reservoir pressure (P=0.01), and -3.6 mm Hg (95% CI, -6.3 to -0.8) for backward pressure amplitude (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Monthly, high-dose, 1-year vitamin D supplementation lowered central BP parameters among adults with vitamin D deficiency but not in the total sample.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationships of many factors with cardiovascular autonomic function (CVAF) outcome parameters may not be uniform across the entire distribution of the outcome. We examined how demographic and clinical factors varied with different subgroups of CVAF parameters. METHODS: Quantile regression was applied to a cross-sectional analysis of 4,167 adults (56% male; age range, 50-84 years) from 4 ethnic groups (3,419 New Zealand European, 303 Pacific, 227 Maori, and 218 South Asian) and without diagnosed cardiac arrhythmia. Pulse rate variability (root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) and SD of pulse intervals) and baroreflex sensitivity were response variables. Independent variables were age, sex, ethnicity, brachial and aortic blood pressure (BP) variables, body mass index (BMI), and diabetes. RESULTS: Ordinary linear regression showed that age, sex, Pacific and Maori ethnicity, BP variables, BMI, and diabetes were associated with CVAF parameters. But quantile regression revealed that, across CVAF percentiles, the slopes for these relationships: (i) varied by more than 10-fold in several cases and sometimes changed direction and (ii) noticeably differed in magnitude often (by >3-fold in several cases) compared to ordinary linear regression coefficients. For instance, age was inversely associated with RMSSD at the 10th percentile of this parameter (beta = -0.12 ms/year, 95% confidence interval = -0.18 to -0.09 ms/year) but had a positive relationship at the 90th percentile (beta = 3.17 ms/year, 95% confidence interval = 2.50 to 4.04 ms/year). CONCLUSIONS: The relationships of demographic and clinical factors with CVAF parameters are, in many cases, not uniform. Quantile regression provides an improved assessment of these associations.},

   abstract = {Clustering of arterial blood pressure (BP) waveform parameters could summarize complex information into distinct elements, which could be used to investigate cumulative (nonredundant) associations. We investigated this hypothesis in a large, adult population-based study (ViDA trial [Vitamin D Assessment] trial). To interpret the clusters and evaluate their usefulness, we examined their predictors and associations with cardiovascular events. In 4253 adults (mean age 65 years; 55% male) without a prior cardiovascular event, suprasystolic oscillometry was performed, yielding aortic pressure waveforms and several hemodynamic parameters. Participants were followed up for 4.6 years (median), accruing 300 cardiovascular events. Principal component analysis reduced 14 arterial waveform parameters to 3 uncorrelated factors that together explained 90% of the variability of the original data. Factors 1, 2, and 3 appeared to represent BP pulsatility, mean BP, and wave reflection, respectively. Across 6 antihypertensive drug classes, there were no differences in brachial systolic (P=0.23) and diastolic (P=0.13) BP; but there were significant variations in factor 3 (P<0.0001), especially for beta-blocker use. The first and third factors were positively associated with cardiovascular events (multivariable-adjusted standardized hazard ratio [95% CI]=1.33 [1.18-1.50] and 1.15 [1.02-1.30], respectively), whereas the second factor had a J-shaped relationship, with a nadir corresponding to a brachial diastolic BP of approximately 75 mm Hg. In conclusion, BP pulsatility, mean BP, and wave reflection are prognostically meaningful, distinct aspects of arterial function that can be used to summarize physiological variations in multiple arterial waveform parameters and identify truly cumulative associations when used as cardiovascular risk outcomes.},

We examined these issues with regard to blood pressure (BP)-related variables in a large, population-based study. Participants were 4942 adults (58% male; aged 50-84 years): 2179 on statin treatment and 2763 untreated. Days of utilization, adherence (proportion of days covered >/=0.8), and discontinuation (non-use for >/=30 days immediately prior to BP measurement) of three statins (atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin) over a period of up to 2 years was monitored retrospectively from electronic databases. Systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), augmentation index, excess pressure, reservoir pressure, and CVAF (pulse rate and BP variability) parameters were calculated from aortic pressure waveforms derived from suprasystolic brachial measurement. Days of statin treatment had inverse relationships with pulse rate variability parameters in cardiac arrhythmic participants (20-25% lower than in statin non-users) and with most arterial function parameters in everyone. For example, compared to untreated participants, those treated for >/=659 days had 3.0 mmHg lower aortic SBP (P < 0.01). Discontinuation was associated with higher brachial DBP and aortic DBP (for both, beta = 2.0 mmHg, P = 0.008). Compared to non-adherent statin users, adherent users had lower levels of brachial SBP, brachial DBP, aortic DBP, aortic SBP, and peak reservoir pressure (beta = -1.4 to -2.6 mmHg). In conclusion, in a real-world setting, statin-therapy duration, non-discontinuation and adherence associate inversely with BP variables and, in cardiac arrhythmias, CVAF parameters.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Comparing the relationships of antihypertensive medications with brachial blood pressure (BP) and aortic waveform parameters may help clinicians to predict the effect on the latter in brachial BP-based antihypertensive therapy. We aimed to make such comparisons with new waveform measures and a wider range of antihypertensive regimens than examined previously. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of 2933 adults (61% male; aged 50-84years): 1637 on antihypertensive treatment and 1296 untreated hypertensives. Sixteen medicine regimens of up to 4 combinations of drugs from 6 antihypertensive classes were analysed. Aortic systolic BP, augmentation index (AIx), excess pressure integral (EPI), backward pressure amplitude (Pb), reflection index (RI) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were calculated from aortic pressure waveforms derived from suprasystolic brachial measurement. RESULTS: Forest plots of single-drug class comparisons across regimens with the same number of drugs (for between 1- and 3-drug regimens) revealed that AIx, Pb, RI and/or loge(EPI) were higher (maximum difference=5.6%, 2.2mmHg, 0.0192 and 0.13 loge(mmHgs), respectively) with the use of a beta-blocker compared with vasodilators and diuretics, despite no brachial systolic and diastolic BP differences. These differences were reduced (by 34-57%) or eliminated after adjustment for heart rate, and similar effects occurred when controlling for systolic ejection period or diastolic duration. CONCLUSIONS: Beta-blocker effects on brachial BP may overestimate effects on aortic waveform parameters. Compared to other antihypertensives, beta-blockers have weaker associations with wave reflection measures and EPI; this is predominantly due to influences on heart rate.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Cerebral blood flow (CBF) estimates from arterial spin labelling (ASL) show unexplained variability in older populations. We studied the impact of variation of haematocrit (Hct) on CBF estimates in a tri-ethnic elderly population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Approval for the study was obtained from the Fulham Research Ethics Committee and participants gave written informed consent. Pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling was performed on 493 subjects (age 55-90) from a tri-ethnic community-based cohort recruited in London. CBF was estimated using a simplified Buxton equation, with and without correction for Hct measured from blood samples. Differences in perfusion were compared, stratified by sex, ethnicity and diabetes. Results of Student's t tests were reported with effect size. RESULTS: Hct adjustment decreased CBF estimates in all categories except white European men. The decrease for women was 2.7 (3.0, 2.4) mL/100 g/min) (mean (95% confidence interval (CI)), p < 0.001 d = 0.38. The effect size differed by ethnicity with estimated mean perfusion in South Asian and African Caribbean women found to be lower by 3.0 (3.6, 2.5) mL/100 g/min, p < 0.001 d = 0.56 and 3.1 (3.6, 2.5) mL/100 g/min), p < 0.001 d = 0.48, respectively. Estimates of perfusion in subjects with diabetes decreased by 1.8 (2.3, 1.4) mL/100 g/min, p < 0.001 d = 0.23) following Hct correction. Correction for individual Hct altered sample frequency distributions of CBF values, especially in women of non-European ethnicity. CONCLUSION: ASL-derived CBF values in women, non-European ethnicities and individuals with diabetes are overestimated if calculations are not appropriately adjusted for individual Hct. KEY POINTS: * CBF quantification from ASL using a fixed Hct of 43.5%, as recommended in the ISMRM white paper, may lead to erroneous CBF estimations particularly in non-European and female subjects. * Individually measured Hct values improve the accuracy of CBF estimation and, if these are not available, an adjusted value according to gender, ethnicity or diabetes status should be considered. * Hct-corrected ASL could be potentially important for CBF threshold decision making in the fields of neurodegenerative disease and neuro-oncology.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association of polymorphisms in complement factor H (CFH) and coronary heart disease (CHD) using meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and CHD may share partially overlapping pathogenesis. A non-synonymous SNP (rs1061170/Y402H) in CFH encoding complement factor H (fH) is robustly associated with increased AMD risk but associations with CHD risk have been inconsistent. METHODS: We conducted de novo genotyping and genetic association analyses of incident and prevalent CHD in four studies, and in silico analysis of the same association in a further four cohorts. We pooled these data with information from all published studies using random effects meta-analysis, including a total of 48,646 participants of which 9097 were CHD cases. We also evaluated the association of Y402H with known risk factors for CHD by pooling results from new and in silico studies providing relevant data. RESULTS: CFH genotype was not associated with CHD. Compared to the reference TT homozygote group the pooled odds ratio (OR) for individuals homozygous for the C allele was 1.02, 95% CI (0.91, 1.13) and that for heterozygote TC individuals was 1.04 (0.98, 1.10). There was no association of CFH with systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total-, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, or body mass index. Individuals who were CC compared to TT had higher triglyceride levels: pooled mean difference 0.06 (0.02, 0.10) mmol/L, p=0.005. CONCLUSIONS: The AMD-associated CFH genotype is not associated with CHD. With the possible exception of triglycerides, this CFH SNP was not associated with a wide range of other CHD risk factors.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association of APOE genotype with circulating apolipoprotein E (ApoE) concentration and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is well established. However, the relationship of circulating ApoE concentration and CVD has received little attention. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To address this, we measured circulating ApoE concentration in 9,587 individuals (with 1,413 CVD events) from three studies with incident CVD events: two population-based studies, the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) and the men-only Northwick Park Heart Study II (NPHSII), and a nested sub-study of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT). We examined the association of circulating ApoE with cardiovascular risk factors in the two population-based studies (ELSA and NPHSII) and the relationship between ApoE concentration and coronary heart disease and stroke in all three studies. Analyses were carried out within study, and, where appropriate, pooled effect estimates were derived using meta-analysis. In the population-based samples, circulating ApoE was associated with systolic blood pressure (correlation coefficient 0.08, p < 0.001, in both ELSA and NPHSII), total cholesterol (correlation coefficient 0.46 and 0.34 in ELSA and NPHSII, respectively; both p < 0.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (correlation coefficient 0.30 and 0.14, respectively; both p < 0.001), high-density lipoprotein (correlation coefficient 0.16 and -0.14, respectively; both p < 0.001), and triglycerides (correlation coefficient 0.43 and 0.46, respectivly; both p < 0.001). In NPHSII, ApoE concentration was additionally associated with apolipoprotein B (correlation coefficient 0.13, p = 0.001) and lipoprotein(a) (correlation coefficient -0.11, p < 0.001). In the pooled analysis of ASCOT, ELSA, and NPHSII, there was no association of ApoE with CVD events; the odds ratio (OR) for CVD events per 1-standard-deviation higher ApoE concentration was 1.02 (95% CI 0.96, 1.09). After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, the OR for CVD per 1-standard-deviation higher ApoE concentration was 0.97 (95% CI 0.82, 1.15). Limitations of these analyses include a polyclonal method of ApoE measurement, rather than isoform-specific measurement, a moderate sample size (although larger than any other study to our knowledge and with a long lag between ApoE measures), and CVD events that may attenuate an effect. CONCLUSIONS: In the largest study to date on this question, we found no evidence of an association of circulating ApoE concentration with CVD events. The established association of APOE genotype with CVD events may be explained by isoform-specific functions as well as other mechanisms, rather than circulating concentrations of ApoE.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Whether adjusting interventricular (VV) delay changes haemodynamic efficacy of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is controversial, with conflicting results. This study addresses whether the convention for keeping atrioventricular (AV) delay constant during VV optimization might explain these conflicts. METHOD AND RESULTS: Twenty-two patients in sinus rhythm with existing CRT underwent VV optimization using non-invasive systolic blood pressure. Interventricular optimization was performed with four methods for keeping the AV delay constant: (i) atrium and left ventricle delay kept constant, (ii) atrium and right ventricle delay kept constant, (iii) time to the first-activated ventricle kept constant, and (iv) time to the second-activated ventricle kept constant. In 11 patients this was performed with AV delay of 120 ms, and in 11 at AV optimum. At AV 120 ms, time to the first ventricular lead (left or right) was the overwhelming determinant of haemodynamics (13.75 mmHg at +/-80 ms, P < 0.001) with no significant effect of time to second lead (0.47 mmHg, P = 0.50), P < 0.001 for difference. At AV optimum, time to first ventricular lead again had a larger effect (5.03 mmHg, P < 0.001) than time to second (2.92 mmHg, P = 0.001), P = 0.02 for difference. CONCLUSION: Time to first ventricular activation is the overwhelming determinant of circulatory function, regardless of whether this is the left or right ventricular lead. If this is kept constant, the effect of changing time to the second ventricle is small or nil, and is not beneficial. In practice, it may be advisable to leave VV delay at zero. Specifying how AV delay is kept fixed might make future VV delay research more enlightening.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Arterial stiffness, as measured by arterial pulse wave velocity (PWV), is an established biomarker for cardiovascular risk and target-organ damage in individuals with hypertension. With the emergence of new devices for assessing PWV, it has become evident that some of these devices yield results that display significant discrepancies compared with previous devices. This discrepancy underscores the importance of comprehensive validation procedures and the need for international recommendations. METHODS: A stepwise approach utilizing the modified Delphi technique, with the involvement of key scientific societies dedicated to arterial stiffness research worldwide, was adopted to formulate, through a multidisciplinary vision, a shared approach to the validation of noninvasive arterial PWV measurement devices. RESULTS: A set of recommendations has been developed, which aim to provide guidance to clinicians, researchers, and device manufacturers regarding the validation of new PWV measurement devices. The intention behind these recommendations is to ensure that the validation process can be conducted in a rigorous and consistent manner and to promote standardization and harmonization among PWV devices, thereby facilitating their widespread adoption in clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: It is hoped that these recommendations will encourage both users and developers of PWV measurement devices to critically evaluate and validate their technologies, ultimately leading to improved consistency and comparability of results. This, in turn, will enhance the clinical utility of PWV as a valuable tool for assessing arterial stiffness and informing cardiovascular risk stratification and management in individuals with hypertension.},

   abstract = {This study was designed to investigate whether calcium-activated potassium channels of small (SK(Ca) or K(Ca)2) and intermediate (IK(Ca) or K(Ca)3.1) conductance activated by 6,7-dichloro-1H-indole-2,3-dione 3-oxime (NS309) are involved in both nitric oxide (NO) and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF)-type relaxation in large and small rat mesenteric arteries. Segments of rat superior and small mesenteric arteries were mounted in myographs for functional studies. NO was recorded using NO microsensors. SK(Ca) and IK(Ca) channel currents and mRNA expression were investigated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and calcium concentrations were investigated in both HUVECs and mesenteric arterial endothelial cells. In both superior ( approximately 1093 mum) and small mesenteric ( approximately 300 mum) arteries, NS309 evoked endothelium- and concentration-dependent relaxations. In superior mesenteric arteries, NS309 relaxations and NO release were inhibited by both N(G),N(G)-asymmetric dimethyl-l-arginine (ADMA) (300 muM), an inhibitor of NO synthase, and apamin (0.5 muM) plus 1-[(2-chlorophenyl)diphenylmethyl]-1H-pyrazole (TRAM-34) (1 muM), blockers of SK(Ca) and IK(Ca) channels, respectively. In small mesenteric arteries, NS309 relaxations were reduced slightly by ADMA, whereas apamin plus an IK(Ca) channel blocker almost abolished relaxation. Iberiotoxin did not change NS309 relaxation. HUVECs expressed mRNA for SK(Ca) and IK(Ca) channels, and NS309 induced increases in calcium, outward current, and NO release that were blocked by apamin and TRAM-34 or charybdotoxin. These findings suggest that opening of SK(Ca) and IK(Ca) channels leads to endothelium-dependent relaxation that is mediated mainly by NO in large mesenteric arteries and by EDHF-type relaxation in small mesenteric arteries. NS309-induced calcium influx appears to contribute to the formation of NO.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The present study investigated whether calcium-activated K+ channels are involved in acetylcholine-evoked nitric oxide (NO) release and relaxation. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Simultaneous measurements of NO concentration and relaxation were performed in rat superior mesenteric artery and endothelial cell membrane potential and intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) were measured. KEY RESULTS: A combination of apamin plus charybotoxin, which are, respectively, blockers of small-conductance and of intermediate- and large-conductance Ca2+ -activated K channels abolished acetylcholine (10 microM)-evoked hyperpolarization of endothelial cell membrane potential. Acetylcholine-evoked NO release was reduced by 68% in high K+ (80 mM) and by 85% in the presence of apamin plus charybdotoxin. In noradrenaline-contracted arteries, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an inhibitor of NO synthase inhibited acetylcholine-evoked NO release and relaxation. However, only further addition of oxyhaemoglobin or apamin plus charybdotoxin eliminated the residual acetylcholine-evoked NO release and relaxation. Removal of extracellular calcium or an inhibitor of calcium influx channels, SKF96365, abolished acetylcholine-evoked increase in NO concentration and [Ca2+]i. Cyclopiazonic acid (CPA, 30 microM), an inhibitor of sarcoplasmic Ca2+ -ATPase, caused a sustained NO release in the presence, but only a transient increase in the absence, of extracellular calcium. Incubation with apamin and charybdotoxin did not change acetylcholine or CPA-induced increases in [Ca2+]i, but inhibited the sustained NO release induced by CPA. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Acetylcholine increases endothelial cell [Ca2+]i by release of stored calcium and calcium influx resulting in activation of apamin and charybdotoxin-sensitive K channels, hyperpolarization and release of NO in the rat superior mesenteric artery.},

   abstract = {Increased intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery predicts increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. Preliminary evidence suggests that a decrease in blood pressure (BP) is associated with diminished wall thickness. It is not known if all classes of anti-hypertensive agents have similar protective effects. In this double-blind parallel-group clinical trial, 69 previously untreated patients with hypertension were allocated randomly to 1 year of treatment with either amlodipine (5-10 mg daily) or lisinopril (5-20 mg daily). Doxazosin and bendrofluazide were added if required to achieve BP control. After 12 months of treatment, clinic BP, ambulatory BP and cardiac mass were reduced similarly by the two treatment regimens. Common carotid artery intima-media thickness decreased by 0.048 mm (95% confidence intervals -0.066, -0.031 mm) in the amlodipine-treated group, but decreased by only 0.027 mm (-0.046, -0.007 mm) in the lisinopril-treated group (P<0.05 for difference between treatments). Common carotid artery lumen diameter declined significantly only in patients treated with lisinopril [amlodipine, -0.02 mm (-0.14, 0.10 mm); lisinopril, -0.21 mm (-0.32, -0.11 mm); P<0.02], while intima-media area declined similarly in the two treatment groups [amlodipine -1.32 mm(2) (-1.91, -0.74 mm(2)), lisinopril -1.26 mm(2) (-1.80, -0.72 mm(2)); not significant]. The results confirm that a decrease in BP causes regression of structural changes in the carotid artery in hypertensive patients. The nature of the structural regression differed markedly between the two treatment regimens, in spite of similar decreases in BP. The calcium channel blocker induced greater regression of common carotid artery intima-media thickness than the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. However, carotid artery wall mass, as indicated by intima-media area, was reduced to a similar extent by the two treatments. It remains to be established whether such differences confer a prognostic advantage.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Afro-Caribbean subjects have a higher prevalence of hypertension, a lower prevalence of ischaemic heart disease and a higher premature mortality compared to White Europeans. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is also more prevalent in Afro-Caribbeans even at similar levels of blood pressure. It is widely believed that carotid artery intima-media thickening (IMT) represents an early marker for the development of atheroma, and carotid IMT and LVH are associated in White populations. Whether the relationship between carotid IMT and LVH is similar in Black subjects is unknown. METHODS: Thirty-eight subjects were studied using carotid and femoral ultrasonography and echocardiography; 19 Afro-Caribbean and 19 White European subjects were matched for age, sex and mean 24 h systolic blood pressure. RESULTS: The Afro-Caribbean group had a significantly greater left ventricular mass index (LVMI) compared to the White European: 136.4 +/- 6.1 versus 112.4 +/- 6.2 g/m2, P < 0.01. However, carotid IMT, carotid diameter, femoral IMT and femoral diameter were similar between the groups: 0.75 +/- 0.02 versus 0.77 +/- 0.04 mm, 6.54 +/- 0.15 versus 6.56 +/- 0.16 mm, 0.66 +/- 0.03 versus 0.68 +/- 0.03 mm and 8.40 +/- 0.33 versus 8.25 +/- 0.23 mm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Afro-Caribbean subjects with similar blood pressures have similar mean carotid and femoral IMTs compared to White Europeans, in spite of marked differences in LVMI. Whether this reflects a discrepancy in the degree of cardiovascular risk for similar levels of LVMI or whether this is a reflection of an altered pattern of target organ damage associated with hypertension in Afro-Caribbean subjects is unclear.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare retinal arterial bifurcation geometry in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. DESIGN: A retrospective observational study. METHODS: Fluorescein angiograms of normotensive (n = 13) and hypertensive (n = 12) subjects aged 30-80 years with uni-ocular retinal pathology were compared. Quantification of diameters of the parent, larger daughter and smaller daughter vessels (d0, d1 and d2, respectively) and of bifurcation angles (the angle between the two daughter arterioles, omega) of arteriolar bifurcations was performed from digitized retinal angiograms of the uninvolved eye. The relative diameters of parent and daughter vessels at bifurcations were summarized by junction exponents (x) such that d1x + d2x = d0x. RESULTS: Junction exponents were similar for normotensives and hypertensives (means +/- SEM, 2.65 +/- 0.18 and 2.48 +/- 0.17), but analysis of covariance showed a parallel decrease in x in the two groups with age. A positive association was found between x and arteriolar microvascular density. Bifurcation angles were more acute in hypertensives (74 +/- 3 degrees) than in normotensives (84 +/- 3 degrees) and declined with increasing age in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings indicate that ageing and possibly hypertension are associated with disadvantageous branching geometry in the human retinal vasculature, implying increased power costs of blood transport, uneven distribution of shear forces throughout the vascular tree and microvascular rarefaction. The present findings may have important implications for our understanding of the pathogenesis of vascular disease in ageing and hypertension and offer the prospect of a novel sensitive diagnostic approach to the cardiovascular system.},

   abstract = {Dietary salt intake is associated with high brachial blood pressure (BP) and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. We investigated whether changes in dietary salt intake are associated with changes in central BP and wave reflection in healthy volunteers. Ten healthy normotensive male volunteers (22-40 yr) participated in a 6-wk double-blind randomized crossover study to compare a low-dietary salt intake (60-80 mmol sodium/day) with a high-salt intake (low salt intake supplemented with 128 mmol sodium/day) on central BP and wave reflection. Brachial and carotid BP, carotid blood flow velocity, forward (P(f)) and backward (P(b)) pressure, wave intensity, body weight, and urinary electrolyte excretion were measured at the end of each crossover period. High salt intake significantly increased carotid systolic BP [98 (SD 11) vs. 91 mmHg (SD 13), P < 0.01] and increased wave reflection [ratio of backward to forward pressure (P(b)/P(f)) 0.13 (SD 0.02) vs. 0.11 (SD 0.03), P = 0.04] despite only small effects on brachial BP [114 (SD 9) vs. 112 mmHg (SD 6), P = 0.1]. Urinary sodium excretion and body weight were also increased following high salt intake. High salt intake disproportionately increases central BP compared with brachial BP as a result of enhanced wave reflection. These effects may contribute to the adverse effect of high dietary salt intake on the risk of cardiovascular disease.},

   abstract = {The objective of the study was to investigate the feasibility of using computational fluid dynamic modeling (CFD) with noninvasive ultrasound measurements to determine time-variant three-dimensional (3D) carotid arterial hemodynamics in humans in vivo. The effects of hyperoxia and hypoxic hypercapnia on carotid artery local hemodynamics were examined by use of this approach. Six normotensive volunteers followed a double-blind randomized crossover design. Blood pressure, heart rate, and carotid blood flow were measured while subjects breathed normal air, a mixture of 5% CO(2) and 15% O(2) (hypoxic hypercapnia), and 100% O(2) (hyperoxia). Carotid artery geometry was reconstructed on the basis of B-mode ultrasound images by using purpose-built image processing software. Time-variant 3D carotid hemodynamics were estimated by using finite volume-based CFD. Systemic blood pressure was not significantly affected by hyperoxia or hypoxic hypercapnia, but heart rate decreased significantly with hyperoxia. There was an increase in diastolic flow velocity in the external carotid artery after hypoxic hypercapnia, but otherwise carotid blood flow velocities did not change significantly. Compared with normal air, hyperoxic conditions were associated with a decrease in the width of the region of flow separation in the external carotid artery. During hyperoxia, there was also an increase in the minimum and a decrease in maximum shear stress in the bifurcation and hence a reduction in cyclic variation in shear stress. Hypoxic hypercapnia was associated with a reduced duration of flow separation in the external carotid artery and an increase in the minimum shear stress without affecting the cyclic variation in shear stress. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using noninvasive ultrasound techniques in conjunction with CFD to describe time-variant 3D hemodynamics in the human carotid arterial bifurcation in vivo.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the association of the inflammatory markers serum amyloid A (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) with retinal microvascular parameters in hypertensive individuals with and without type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis was a substudy in 711 patients (159 with and 552 without diabetes) of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) based on digital 30-degree images of superior and inferior temporal retinal fields. RESULTS: SAA was associated with arteriolar length-to-diameter ratio positively in nondiabetic patients (P(trend)= 0.028) but negatively in diabetic patients (P(trend)= 0.005). The difference was unlikely to be a chance finding (P = 0.007 for interaction). Similar results were found for the association of SAA with arteriolar tortuosity (P = 0.05 for interaction). Associations were less pronounced for CRP and retinal parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory processes are differentially involved in retinal microvascular disease in diabetic compared with nondiabetic hypertensive individuals.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe prevalent vascular retinal lesions among patients with type 2 diabetes enrolled in the ADVANCE Retinal Measurements (AdRem) study, a substudy of the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Seven-field stereoscopic photographs of both eyes were obtained at the baseline assessment of the ADVANCE trial. All photographs were graded in a central reading center. Gradable retinal images were received from 1,605 patients. RESULTS: The number of patients with any retinopathy (Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS] score > or = 20) was 645 (40.2% [95% CI 37.8-42.6]); of these, 35 (2.2% [1.6-3.0]) had severe diabetic retinopathy (ETDRS score > or = 50). Focal arterial narrowing, venous beading, and arteriovenous nicking were present in 3.8, 5.1, and 9.8% of participants, respectively. Among participants included in this study, Chinese and South-Asian patients had more retinopathy than Caucasians, as defined both by ETDRS score (49.4, 46.0, and 31.3%, respectively; P < 0.001, adjusted for age, sex, A1C, systolic blood pressure, and duration of diabetes) and specific vascular lesions (e.g., arteriovenous nicking 12.3, 8.5, and 7.5%, respectively; adjusted P < 0.005). A1C, duration of diabetes, and systolic blood pressure were similarly associated with increased retinal lesions in Chinese, South-Asian, and Caucasian patients. CONCLUSIONS: Using a sensitive diagnostic procedure, more than one-third of patients with type 2 diabetes enrolled in the AdRem study had retinal lesions at baseline. Despite differences in prevalence and severity of retinopathy among Chinese, South-Asian, and Caucasian patients included in this study, the cross-sectional associations among established risk factors for retinopathy and retinal lesions were similar across ethnic groups.},

The AdRem study is based on seven-field stereoscopic retinal photographs of both eyes. These are taken within 3 months after randomization in ADVANCE (baseline), at the biennial and at the final visit. The primary outcome is progression of two or more steps in ETDRS classification. Secondary outcomes include progression of retinal vascular lesions and distortion of retinal vascular geometry. Retinal photographs are made on film and digitized at a central laboratory. The AdRem study uses fully digitized quality control and grading. Between August 2002 and January 2004 1978 patients were included in the AdRem study, from 39 centers in 14 countries. Approximately 85% comply with the strict AdRem quality requirements. Publication of the results is expected in early 2008. The AdRem study is designed to provide reliable evidence on the effects of intensive glucose control and blood pressure lowering on both diabetic retinopathy and abnormalities of retinal vasculature in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microvascular dysfunction may be an early precursor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Increased left ventricular mass (LVM), concentric left ventricular remodelling and increased left atrial size are the factors that could predict future CVD. We investigated whether microvascular dysfunction was associated with these cardiac measures. METHODS AND RESULTS: Laser Doppler fluximetry of skin vessels was used to study associations with risk factors and echocardiographic measurements of LVM, relative wall thickness (RWT), and left atrial size in 305 people (aged 40-65 years; 117 with type 2 diabetes). Flow in response to a 3-min arterial occlusion was measured. Postischaemic peak flow responses were categorized into three distinct groups: slow rise to peak (normal), nondominant early peak group (mildly abnormal) and a dominant early peak (abnormal). Those with a dominant early peak had higher blood pressure (P = 0.001), weight (P = 0.001), fasting glucose (P = 0.001) and prevalence of diabetes (P = 0.02). LVM (P = 0.01), RWT (P < 0.001) and left atrial size (P < 0.001) were greater with worsening postischaemic peak flow responses. Differences in LVM between postischaemic response groups were accounted for by blood pressure (BP). However, differences in BP and other CVD risk factors did not account for the greater RWT and left atrial size observed in the more adverse peak response groups [geometric mean of RWT [95% confidence interval (CI)] 0.40 (0.38-0.41) vs. 0.41 (0.40-0.42) vs. 0.43 (0.41-0.45), P = 0.007; left atrial size 36.1 (35.4-36.1) vs. 37.4 (36.8-38.0) vs. 38.7 (37.5-40.0), P = 0.002 for normal vs. mildly abnormal vs. abnormal respectively]. CONCLUSION: An abnormal microcirculatory cutaneous peak flow response following ischaemia is associated with adverse cardiac remodelling, independent of CVD risk factors including blood pressure.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Indian Asians are at increased risk of cardiovascular death which does not appear to be explained by conventional risk factors. As microvascular disease is also more prevalent in Indian Asians, and as it is thought to play a role in the development of macrovascular disease, we decided to determine whether impaired microcirculation could contribute to this increased cardiovascular risk in Indian Asians. METHODS: Forearm skin laser Doppler fluximetry in response to heating and ischaemia was assessed in 83 Europeans (41 with angiographically confirmed atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) and 42 from the general population) and 84 Indian Asians (41 with CAD). Explanations for differences in microvascular function were sought using multivariate analysis including conventional cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: Compared to ethnically matched control populations both Europeans and Indian Asians with CAD had poorer microvascular responses to heating than those without (117(95% CI 105-131) vs. 142(130-162) arbitrary units, (au) for Europeans and 111(101-122) vs. 141(131-153)au for Indian Asians) and to ischaemia (44(38-50) vs. 57(49-67)au & 39(34-45) vs. 49(43-56)au respectively). These differences were not accounted for by conventional cardiovascular risk factors. There was no ethnic difference in the attenuation of microvascular function associated with CAD. CONCLUSION: Patients of European and Indian Asian descent with symptomatic CAD have poorer microvascular maximal tissue perfusion and reactive hyperaemia in the skin compared to ethnically matched asymptomatic control populations. Despite the increased cardiovascular risk in Indian Asians, the attenuation of microvascular function associated with CAD was equivalent in the ethic groups. This suggests that in Indian Asians microcirculation does not explain the increased susceptibility to CAD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Refractory angina is the occurrence of clinical symptoms despite maximal therapy. We investigated associations between microvascular function, atherosclerotic burden, and clinical symptoms in subjects with CAD. METHODS: Skin microvascular response to heating and ischemia was assessed in 167 male volunteers by laser Doppler fluximetry; 82 with CAD on maximal therapy and 85 with no known CAD (noCAD). CAC scores, carotid IMT, and femoral IMT were measured and symptoms were scored using the Rose angina questionnaire. RESULTS: Patients with CAD had poorer microvascular response to heating (114[95% CI 106-122]au CAD vs. 143[134-153]au no CAD; p < 0.0001) and ischemia (42[38-46]au CAD vs. 53[78-58]au. noCAD; p = 0.001). Thirty-eight percent of the noCAD group had elevated CAC scores. There were no associations between markers of atherosclerosis and microvascular function. Forty-two percent of the CAD group had refractory angina. This was associated with impaired microvascular function compared to those with elevated CAC scores but no symptoms (109 [95-124]au vs. 131[122-140]au; p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Men with symptomatic CAD have poorer microvascular function compared to individuals without CAD. Microvascular function does not correlate with atherosclerosis, but is impaired in individuals with refractory angina. Microvascular dysfunction may play a role in the symptomatology of angina.},

   abstract = {Mean pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) remain the most common haemodynamic measures to evaluate the severity and prognosis of pulmonary hypertension. However, PVR only captures the non-oscillatory component of the right ventricular hydraulic load and neglects the dynamic compliance of the pulmonary arteries and the contribution of wave transmission. Wave intensity analysis offers an alternative way to assess the pulmonary vasculature in health and disease. Wave speed is a measure of arterial stiffness, and the magnitude and timing of wave reflection provide information on the degree of impedance mismatch between the proximal and distal circulation. Studies in the pulmonary artery have demonstrated distinct differences in arterial wave propagation between individuals with and without pulmonary vascular disease. Notably, greater wave speed and greater wave reflection are observed in patients with pulmonary hypertension and in animal models exposed to hypoxia. Studying wave propagation makes a valuable contribution to the assessment of the arterial system in pulmonary hypertension, and here, we briefly review the current state of knowledge of the methods used to evaluate arterial waves in the pulmonary artery.},

   abstract = {High wave speed and large wave reflection in the pulmonary artery have previously been reported in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). We assessed the impact of pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) on pulmonary arterial wave propagation and reservoir function in patients with CTEPH. Right heart catheterization was performed using a combined pressure and Doppler flow sensor-tipped guidewire to obtain simultaneous pressure and flow velocity measurements in the pulmonary artery in eight patients with CTEPH before and 3 mo after PEA. Wave intensity and reservoir-excess pressure analyses were then performed. Following PEA, mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAPm; approximately 49 vs. approximately 32 mmHg), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR; approximately 11.1 vs. approximately 5.1 Wood units), and wave speed ( approximately 16.5 vs. approximately 8.1 m/s), i.e., local arterial stiffness, markedly decreased. The changes in the intensity of the reflected arterial wave and wave reflection index (pre: approximately 28%; post: approximately 22%) were small, and patients post-PEA with and without residual pulmonary hypertension (i.e., PAPm >/= 25 mmHg) had similar wave reflection index ( approximately 20 vs. approximately 23%). The reservoir and excess pressure decreased post-PEA, and the changes were associated with improved right ventricular afterload, function, and size. In conclusion, although PVR and arterial stiffness decreased substantially following PEA, large wave reflection persisted, even in patients without residual pulmonary hypertension, indicating lack of improvement in vascular impedance mismatch. This may continue to affect the optimal ventriculoarterial interaction, and further studies are warranted to determine whether this contributes to persistent symptoms in some patients.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We performed wave intensity analysis in the pulmonary artery in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension before and 3 mo after pulmonary endarterectomy. Despite substantial reduction in pulmonary arterial pressures, vascular resistance, and arterial stiffness, large pulmonary arterial wave reflection persisted 3 mo postsurgery, even in patients without residual pulmonary hypertension, suggestive of lack of improvement in vascular impedance mismatch.},

   abstract = {Arterial stiffness and wave reflection are important components of the ventricular afterload. Therefore, we aimed to assess the arterial wave characteristics and mechanical properties of the proximal pulmonary arteries (PAs) in the hypoxic pulmonary hypertensive rat model. After 21 days in normoxic or hypoxic chambers (24 animals/group), animals underwent transthoracic echocardiography and PA catheterization with a dual-tipped pressure and Doppler flow sensor wire. Wave intensity analysis was performed. Artery rings obtained from the pulmonary trunk, right and left PAs, and aorta were subjected to a tensile test to rupture. Collagen and elastin content were determined. In hypoxic rats, proximal PA wall thickness, collagen content, tensile strength per unit collagen, maximal elastic modulus, and wall viscosity increased, whereas the elastin-to-collagen ratio and arterial distensibility decreased. Arterial pulse wave velocity was also increased, and the increase was more prominent in vivo than ex vivo. Wave intensity was similar in hypoxic and normoxic animals with negligible wave reflection. In contrast, the aortic maximal elastic modulus remained unchanged, whereas wall viscosity decreased. In conclusion, there was no evidence of altered arterial wave propagation in proximal PAs of hypoxic rats while the extracellular matrix protein composition was altered and collagen tensile strength increased. This was accompanied by altered mechanical properties in vivo and ex vivo. NEW & NOTEWORTHY In rats exposed to chronic hypoxia, we have shown that pulse wave velocity in the proximal pulmonary arteries increased and pressure dependence of the pulse wave velocity was steeper in vivo than ex vivo leading to a more prominent increase in vivo.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In contrast to systemic hypertension, the significance of arterial waves in pulmonary hypertension (PH) is not well understood. We hypothesized that arterial wave energy and wave reflection are augmented in PH and that wave behavior differs between patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). METHODS AND RESULTS: Right heart catheterization was performed using a pressure and Doppler flow sensor-tipped catheter to obtain simultaneous pressure and flow velocity measurements in the pulmonary artery. Wave intensity analysis was subsequently applied to the acquired data. Ten control participants, 11 patients with PAH, and 10 patients with CTEPH were studied. Wave speed and wave power were significantly greater in PH patients compared with controls, indicating increased arterial stiffness and right ventricular work, respectively. The ratio of wave power to mean right ventricular power was lower in PAH patients than CTEPH patients and controls. Wave reflection index in PH patients (PAH: approximately 25%; CTEPH: approximately 30%) was significantly greater compared with controls ( approximately 4%), indicating downstream vascular impedance mismatch. Although wave speed was significantly correlated to disease severity, wave reflection indexes of patients with mildly and severely elevated pulmonary pressures were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Wave reflection in the pulmonary artery increased in PH and was unrelated to severity, suggesting that vascular impedance mismatch occurs early in the development of pulmonary vascular disease. The lower wave power fraction in PAH compared with CTEPH indicates differences in the intrinsic and/or extrinsic ventricular load between the 2 diseases.},

   abstract = {KEY POINTS: Wave travel plays an important role in cardiovascular physiology. However, many aspects of pulmonary arterial wave behaviour remain unclear. Wave intensity and reservoir-excess pressure analyses were applied in the pulmonary artery in subjects with and without pulmonary hypertension during spontaneous respiration and dynamic stress tests. Arterial wave energy decreased during expiration and Valsalva manoeuvre due to decreased ventricular preload. Wave energy also decreased during handgrip exercise due to increased heart rate. In pulmonary hypertension patients, the asymptotic pressure at which the microvascular flow ceases, the reservoir pressure related to arterial compliance and the excess pressure caused by waves increased. The reservoir and excess pressures decreased during Valsalva manoeuvre but remained unchanged during handgrip exercise. This study provides insights into the influence of pulmonary vascular disease, spontaneous respiration and dynamic stress tests on pulmonary artery wave propagation and reservoir function. ABSTRACT: Detailed haemodynamic analysis may provide novel insights into the pulmonary circulation. Therefore, wave intensity and reservoir-excess pressure analyses were applied in the pulmonary artery to characterize changes in wave propagation and reservoir function during spontaneous respiration and dynamic stress tests. Right heart catheterization was performed using a pressure and Doppler flow sensor tipped guidewire to obtain simultaneous pressure and flow velocity measurements in the pulmonary artery in control subjects and patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) at rest. In controls, recordings were also obtained during Valsalva manoeuvre and handgrip exercise. The asymptotic pressure at which the flow through the microcirculation ceases, the reservoir pressure related to arterial compliance and the excess pressure caused by arterial waves increased in PAH patients compared to controls. The systolic and diastolic rate constants also increased, while the diastolic time constant decreased. The forward compression wave energy decreased by approximately 8% in controls and approximately 6% in PAH patients during expiration compared to inspiration, while the wave speed remained unchanged throughout the respiratory cycle. Wave energy decreased during Valsalva manoeuvre (by approximately 45%) and handgrip exercise (by approximately 27%) with unaffected wave speed. Moreover, the reservoir and excess pressures decreased during Valsalva manoeuvre but remained unaltered during handgrip exercise. In conclusion, reservoir-excess pressure analysis applied to the pulmonary artery revealed distinctive differences between controls and PAH patients. Variations in the ventricular preload and afterload influence pulmonary arterial wave propagation as demonstrated by changes in wave energy during spontaneous respiration and dynamic stress tests.},

Right heart catheterization was performed using a pressure and Doppler flow sensor-tipped catheter to obtain simultaneous pressure and flow velocity measurements in the pulmonary artery in 10 controls, 11 PAH patients, and 11 CTEPH patients. PWA was applied to the measured pressure, while wave intensity analysis (WIA) and wave separation analysis (WSA) were performed using both the pressure and velocity to determine the magnitudes and timings of reflected waves. Type C (AI < 0) pressure waveform dominated in controls and type A (AI > 12%) waveform dominated in PAH patients, while there was a mixture of types A, B, and C among CTEPH patients. AI was greater and the inflection time shorter in CTEPH compared to PAH patients. There was a poor correlation between AI and arterial wave speed as well as measures of wave reflection derived from WIA and WSA. The infection point did not match the timing of the backward compression wave in ~50% of the cases. In patients with type C waveforms, the inflection time correlated well to the timing of the late systolic forward decompression wave caused by ventricular relaxation. In conclusion quantifying pulmonary arterial wave reflection and stiffness using AI based on PWA may be inaccurate and should therefore be discouraged.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Visual rating scales have limited capacities to depict the regional distribution of cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMH). We present a regional-zonal volumetric analysis alongside a visualization tool to compare and deconstruct visual rating scales. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 3D T1-weighted, T2-weighted spin-echo and FLAIR images were acquired on a 3T system, from 82 elderly participants in a population-based study. Images were automatically segmented for WMH. Lobar boundaries and distance to ventricular surface were used to define white matter regions. Regional-zonal WMH loads were displayed using bullseye plots. Four raters assessed all images applying three scales. Correlations between visual scales and regional WMH as well as inter and intra-rater variability were assessed. A multinomial ordinal regression model was used to predict scores based on regional volumes and global WMH burdens. RESULTS: On average, the bullseye plot depicted a right-left symmetry in the distribution and concentration of damage in the periventricular zone, especially in frontal regions. WMH loads correlated well with the average visual rating scores (e.g. Kendall's tau [Volume, Scheltens]=0.59 CI=[0.53 0.62]). Local correlations allowed comparison of loading patterns between scales and between raters. Regional measurements had more predictive power than global WMH burden (e.g. frontal caps prediction with local features: ICC=0.67 CI=[0.53 0.77], global volume=0.50 CI=[0.32 0.65], intra-rater=0.44 CI=[0.23 0.60]). CONCLUSION: Regional-zonal representation of WMH burden highlights similarities and differences between visual rating scales and raters. The bullseye infographic tool provides a simple visual representation of regional lesion load that can be used for rater calibration and training.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Risk of stroke and dementia is markedly higher in people of South Asian and African Caribbean descent than white Europeans in the UK. This is unexplained by cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF). We hypothesized this might indicate accelerated early vascular aging (EVA) and that EVA might account for stronger associations between cerebral large artery characteristics and markers of small vessel disease. METHODS: 360 participants in a tri-ethnic population-based study (120 per ethnic group) underwent cerebral and vertebral MRI. Length and median diameter of the basilar artery (BA) were derived from Time of Flight images, while white matter hyperintensities (WMH) volumes were obtained from T1 and FLAIR images. Associations between BA characteristics and CVRF were assessed using multivariable linear regression. Partial correlation coefficients between WMH load and BA characteristics were calculated after adjustment for CVRF and other potential confounders. RESULTS: BA diameter was strongly associated with age in South Asians (+11.3 mum/year 95% CI = [3.05; 19.62]; p = 0.008), with unconvincing relationships in African Caribbeans (3.4 mum/year [-5.26, 12.12]; p = 0.436) or Europeans (2.6 mum/year [-5.75, 10.87]; p = 0.543). BA length was associated with age in South Asians (+0.34 mm/year [0.02; 0.65]; p = 0.037) and African Caribbeans (+0.39 mm/year [0.12; 0.65]; p = 0.005) but not Europeans (+0.08 mm/year [-0.26; 0.41]; p = 0.653). BA diameter (rho = 0.210; p = 0.022) and length (rho = 0.261; p = 0.004) were associated with frontal WMH load in South Asians (persisting after multivariable adjustment for CVRF). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with Europeans, the basilar artery undergoes more accelerated EVA in South Asians and in African Caribbeans, albeit to a lesser extent. Such EVA may contribute to the higher burden of CSVD observed in South Asians and excess risk of stroke, vascular cognitive impairment and dementia observed in these ethnic groups.},

   abstract = {Background Cardiovascular risk factors vary between ethnicities but little is known about their differential effects on white matter hyperintensities ( WMH ), an indicator of brain aging and burden of cerebrovascular disease. Methods and Results Brain magnetic resonance imaging scans from 213 people of South Asian and 256 of European ethnicity (total=469) were analyzed for global and regional WMH load. Associations with cardiovascular risk factors and a composite cardiovascular risk score (National Cholesterol Education Programme Adult Treatment Panel III) were compared by ethnicity, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and hypertension status. Distributional patterns of WMH were similar by ethnicity but the vulnerability to specific risk factors differed. Associations between WMH and age or National Cholesterol Education Programme Adult Treatment Panel III scores were stronger in South Asians compared with Europeans. For instance, a year of age led to an excess of 3.8% (confidence interval=[0.2, 7.6]; P=0.04) of WMH load in frontal regions in South Asians compared with Europeans. In the diabetic subgroup, South Asians had more WMH than Europeans (+63.3%, confidence interval=[14.1, 133.9]; P=0.007), particularly in the deeper regions (+102% confidence interval=[24, 329]; P=0.004). In the population as a whole, diabetes mellitus was not, or only weakly, related to an increase in WMH volume (12.4%, confidence interval=[-10.7, 41.3]; P=0.32), and diabetes mellitus duration was a positive predictor of frontal periventricular WMH load in Europeans but not in South Asians. In turn, diastolic blood pressure was positively associated with WMH volumes in South Asians but not in Europeans. Hypertension was not associated with WMH load ( P=0.9). Conclusions Distribution patterns of WMH are similar in South Asians and Europeans but older age and higher cardiovascular risk are associated with more WMH in South Asians.},

This challenge aimed to promote the development of methods for automated detection and segmentation of small and sparse imaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease, namely enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) (Task 1), cerebral microbleeds (Task 2) and lacunes of presumed vascular origin (Task 3) while leveraging weak and noisy labels. Overall, 12 teams participated in the challenge proposing solutions for one or more tasks (4 for Task 1-EPVS, 9 for Task 2-Microbleeds and 6 for Task 3-Lacunes). Multi-cohort data was used in both training and evaluation. Results showed a large variability in performance both across teams and across tasks, with promising results notably for Task 1-EPVS and Task 2-Microbleeds and not practically useful results yet for Task 3-Lacunes. It also highlighted the performance inconsistency across cases that may deter use at an individual level, while still proving useful at a population level.},

   abstract = {Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a degenerative disease in which the afflicted person suffers from a localised dilatation of the abdominal aorta. Intraluminal thrombus (ILT), which is present in approximately 75% of all AAAs, plays an important role in the progression of the disease. It has been suggested that ILT may attenuate oxygen diffusion to the aortic wall, resulting in further degeneration and weakening of the wall. Previous numerical studies using idealised AAA models have shown the effect of ILT thickness on oxygen diffusion, but patient-specific studies of oxygen transport incorporating convection, diffusion and reaction from the lumen to AAA wall are lacking. In the present study, a coupled fluid-thrombus-wall model was developed to simulate oxygen transport in a patient-specific AAA containing ILT. Blood flow in the lumen was governed by the Navier-Stokes equations and oxygen transfer was described by the convection-diffusion equation in the lumen, diffusion equation in the thrombus, and diffusion-reaction equation in the wall. A parametric study was performed to evaluate the sensitivity of numerical predictions to oxygen diffusivity in ILT and adventitial oxygen concentration. The results not only provide further support to previous findings that the presence of ILT may significantly impair oxygen transfer from blood to the aortic wall, but also demonstrate that adventitial oxygen concentration has a profound effect on oxygen concentration in the wall, and that the oxygen supply from the lumen to the wall can be reduced by 80% if the ILT thickness is greater than 5 mm.},

   abstract = {Low wall shear stress (WSS) is implicated in endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis. The accumulation of macromolecules is also considered as an important factor contributing to the development of atherosclerosis. In the present study, a fluid-wall single-layered model incorporated with shear-dependent transport parameters was used to investigate albumin and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) transport in an in vivo computed tomographic image-based human right coronary artery (RCA). In the fluid-wall model, the bulk blood flow was modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations, Darcy's law was employed to model the transmural flow in the arterial wall, mass balance of albumin and LDL was governed by the convection-diffusion mechanism with an additional reaction term in the wall, and the Kedem-Katchalsky equations were applied at the endothelium as the interface condition between the lumen and wall. Shear-dependent models for hydraulic conductivity and albumin permeability were derived from experimental data in literature to investigate the influence of WSS on macromolecular accumulation in the arterial wall. A previously developed so-called lumen-free time-averaged scheme was used to approximate macromolecular transport under pulsatile flow conditions. LDL and albumin accumulations in the subendothelial layer were found to be colocalized with low WSS. Two distinct mechanisms responsible for the localized accumulation were identified: one was insufficient efflux from the subendothelial layer to outer wall layers caused by a weaker transmural flow; the other was excessive influx to the subendothelial layer from the lumen caused by a higher permeability of the endothelium. The comparison between steady flow and pulsatile flow results showed that the dynamic behavior of the pulsatile flow could induce a wider and more diffuse macromolecular accumulation pattern through the nonlinear shear-dependent transport properties. Therefore, it is vital to consider blood pulsatility when modeling the shear-dependent macromolecular transport in large arteries. In the present study, LDL and albumin accumulations were observed in the low WSS regions of a human RCA using a fluid-wall mass transport model. It was also found that steady flow simulation could overestimate the magnitude and underestimate the area of accumulations. The association between low WSS and accumulation of macromolecules leading to atherosclerosis may be mediated through effects on transport properties and mass transport and is also influenced by flow pulsatility.},

The accumulation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and hypoxia are also considered as main contributing factors in the development of atherosclerosis. The objective of this study was to investigate the influences of WSS on arterial mass transport by modelling the flow of blood and solute transport in the lumen and arterial wall. The Navier-Stokes equations and Darcy's Law were used to describe the fluid dynamics of the blood in the lumen and wall respectively. Convection-diffusion-reaction equations were used to model LDL and oxygen transport. The coupling of fluid dynamics and solute dynamics at the endothelium was achieved by the Kedem-Katchalsky equations. A shear-dependent hydraulic conductivity relation extracted from experimental data in the literature was employed for the transport of LDL and a shear-dependent permeability was used for oxygen. The integrated fluid-wall model was implemented in Comsol Multiphysics 3.2 and applied to an axisymmetric stenosis. The results showed elevated LDL concentration and reduced oxygen concentration in the subendothelial layer of the arterial wall in areas where WSS is low, suggesting that low WSS might be responsible for lipid accumulation and hypoxia in the arterial wall.},

   abstract = {The accumulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is one of the important factors in atherogenesis. Two different time scales may influence LDL transport in vivo: (1) LDL transport is coupled to blood flow with a pulse cycle of around 1 s in humans; (2) LDL transport within the arterial wall is mediated by transmural flow in the order of 10(-8) m/s. Most existing models have assumed steady flow conditions and overlooked the interactions between physical phenomena with different time scales. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of pulsatile flow on LDL transport and examine the validity of steady flow assumption. The effect of pulsatile flow on transmural transport was incorporated by using a lumen-free cyclic (LFC) and a lumen-free time-averaged (LFTA) procedures. It is found that the steady flow simulation predicted a focal distribution in the post-stenotic region, differing from the diffuse distribution pattern produced by the pulsatile flow simulation. The LFTA procedure, in which time-averaged shear-dependent transport properties calculated from instantaneous wall shear stress (WSS) were used, predicted a similar distribution pattern to the LFC simulations. We conclude that the steady flow assumption is inadequate and instantaneous hemodynamic conditions have important influence on LDL transmural transport in arterial geometries with disturbed and complicated flow patterns.},

Mathematical models have been constructed to simulate mass transport in large arteries and the consequent lipid accumulation in the arterial wall. The objective of this study was to investigate the influences of wall shear stress and transmural pressure on LDL accumulation in the arterial wall by a multilayered, coupled lumen-wall model. The model employs the Navier-Stokes equations and Darcy's Law for fluid dynamics, convection-diffusion-reaction equations for mass balance, and Kedem-Katchalsky equations for interfacial coupling. To determine physiologically realistic model parameters, an optimization approach that searches optimal parameters based on experimental data was developed. Two sets of model parameters corresponding to different transmural pressures were found by the optimization approach using experimental data in the literature. Furthermore, a shear-dependent hydraulic conductivity relation reported previously was adopted. The integrated multilayered model was applied to an axisymmetric stenosis simulating an idealized, mildly stenosed coronary artery. The results show that low wall shear stress leads to focal LDL accumulation by weakening the convective clearance effect of transmural flow, whereas high transmural pressure, associated with hypertension, leads to global elevation of LDL concentration in the arterial wall by facilitating the passage of LDL through wall layers.},

   abstract = {1. Small arteries were isolated from either rat mesentery or human subcutaneous fat, and mounted in a myograph for the measurement of isometric force. 2. Superoxide dismutase, either in the presence or absence of catalase, relaxed noradrenaline-induced tone. This effect was abolished by removal of the endothelium or incubation with an inhibitor of NO synthase, N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. Catalase alone had a negligible effect on noradrenaline-induced tone. 3. Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and putative free-radical scavenger, did not relax pre-contracted isolated vessels. N-Acetylcysteine caused an endothelium-independent relaxation of rat vessels. Similar effects were observed in human vessels. 4. Acetylcholine induced a concentration-dependent relaxation of isolated resistance arteries, which was inhibited by removal of the endothelium or N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, but unaffected by indomethacin. Preincubation with captopril, N-acetylcysteine or catalase alone did not alter the acetylcholine concentration-response relationship, but superoxide dismutase in combination with catalase enhanced responses to acetylcholine, causing a six-fold increase in potency. 5. Superoxide dismutase causes endothelium-dependent relaxation of resistance arteries and potentiates responses to acetylcholine. This action is probably due to the ability of the enzyme to scavenge superoxide anions which inhibit endothelium-dependent relaxation. 6. N-Acetylcysteine causes an endothelium-independent relaxation of resistance arteries which is probably unrelated to the putative ability of this compound to scavenge superoxide radicals and may reflect a direct action on vascular smooth muscle.},

   abstract = {Background: It is well-established that what is good for the heart is good for the brain. Vascular factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol, and genetic factors such as the apolipoprotein E4 allele increase the risk of developing both cardiovascular disease and dementia. However, the mechanisms underlying the heart-brain association remain unclear. Recent evidence suggests that impairments in vascular phenotypes and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) may play an important role in cognitive decline. The Heart and Brain Study combines state-of-the-art vascular ultrasound, cerebrovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cognitive testing in participants of the long-running Whitehall II Imaging cohort to examine these processes together. This paper describes the study protocol, data pre-processing and overarching objectives. Methods and Design: The 775 participants of the Whitehall II Imaging cohort, aged 65 years or older in 2019, have received clinical and vascular risk assessments at 5-year-intervals since 1985, as well as a 3T brain MRI scan and neuropsychological tests between 2012 and 2016 (Whitehall II Wave MRI-1). Approximately 25% of this cohort are selected for the Heart and Brain Study, which involves a single testing session at the University of Oxford (Wave MRI-2). Between 2019 and 2023, participants will undergo ultrasound scans of the ascending aorta and common carotid arteries, measures of central and peripheral blood pressure, and 3T MRI scans to measure CVR in response to 5% carbon dioxide in air, vessel-selective cerebral blood flow (CBF), and cerebrovascular lesions. The structural and diffusion MRI scans and neuropsychological battery conducted at Wave MRI-1 will also be repeated. Using this extensive life-course data, the Heart and Brain Study will examine how 30-year trajectories of vascular risk throughout midlife (40-70 years) affect vascular phenotypes, cerebrovascular health, longitudinal brain atrophy and cognitive decline at older ages. Discussion: The study will generate one of the most comprehensive datasets to examine the longitudinal determinants of the heart-brain association. It will evaluate novel physiological processes in order to describe the optimal window for managing vascular risk in order to delay cognitive decline. Ultimately, the Heart and Brain Study will inform strategies to identify at-risk individuals for targeted interventions to prevent or delay dementia.},

   abstract = {In this study, newly developed two-equation turbulence models and transitional variants are employed for the prediction of blood flow patterns in a diseased carotid artery where the growth, progression, and structure of the plaque at rupture are closely linked to low and oscillating wall shear stresses. Moreover, the laminar-turbulent transition in the poststenotic zone can alter the separation zone length, wall shear stress, and pressure distribution over the plaque, with potential implications for stresses within the plaque. Following the validation with well established experimental measurements and numerical studies, a magnetic-resonance (MR) image-based model of the carotid bifurcation with 70% stenosis was reconstructed and simulated using realistic patient-specific conditions. Laminar flow, a correlation-based transitional version of Menter's hybrid k-epsilon/k-omega shear stress transport (SST) model and its "scale adaptive simulation" (SAS) variant were implemented in pulsatile simulations from which analyses of velocity profiles, wall shear stress, and turbulence intensity were conducted. In general, the transitional version of SST and its SAS variant are shown to give a better overall agreement than their standard counterparts with experimental data for pulsatile flow in an axisymmetric stenosed tube. For the patient-specific case reported, the wall shear stress analysis showed discernable differences between the laminar flow and SST transitional models but virtually no difference between the SST transitional model and its SAS variant.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) provides a non-invasive, cost-effective method for assessing skeletal muscle oxidative capacity when combined with a short exercise protocol and arterial occlusions. However, the impact of different exercise protocols and reproducibility of the method in non-athletic adults have not previously been assessed. METHODS: Young, non-athletic adults (YA) were invited to perform a short duration, fast frequency contraction (SF) exercise protocol and a long duration slow frequency (LS) contraction protocol, combined with NIRS measurements and arterial occlusions to assess skeletal muscle oxidative capacity. YA and older non-athletic adults (OA; >65 years old) were invited to perform the SF exercise protocol twice to assess the reproducibility of this oxidative capacity measurement. RESULTS: We included 25 participants (14 male (56%), age range: 18-86 years) in the analyses. There was a strong positive correlation and good agreement between time constants derived following the SF and LS exercise protocols (Lin's concordance correlation coefficient: 0.69, p-value < 0.001 mean bias [LoA]: -3.2 [-31.0, 24.4] seconds. There was a strong positive correlation and good agreement between time constants derived from the SF exercise protocol in the YA & OA group (Lin's concordance correlation coefficient: 0.63, p-value < 0.001; mean bias [LoA] -6.4 [-34.0, 21.3] seconds). CONCLUSION: These data provide evidence to suggest that NIRS is a reliable in vivo method for the assessment of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity irrespective of exercise protocol duration or muscle contraction frequency. NIRS-measured oxidative capacity via the SF exercise protocol was reproducible in non-athletic adults with a wide range in age.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease shares many risk factors with other metabolic disorders. We sought to establish whether non-alcoholic fatty liver disease may be associated with cardiovascular health independently of other known risk factors. METHODS: In this prospective, population-based cohort of young adults, controlled attenuation parameter-defined liver steatosis, transient elastography-defined liver fibrosis, echocardiography, carotid ultrasonography, and pulse wave analysis were assessed at age 24 years. We examined associations between liver and cardiovascular measures, with and without accounting for demographics, body mass index, alcohol, smoking, blood pressure, lipidemia, glycemia, and inflammation. RESULTS: We included 2047 participants (mean age 24.4 y; 36.2% female): 212 (10.4%) had steatosis, whereas 38 (1.9%) had fibrosis. Steatosis was associated with cardiovascular measures after adjusting for demographics, but with more comprehensive adjustment, steatosis only remained associated with stroke index [beta (95% CI) of -1.85 (-3.29, -0.41) mL/m2] and heart rate [2.17 (0.58, 3.75) beats/min]. Fibrosis was associated with several measures of cardiovascular structure and function after full adjustment for risk factors, including left ventricular mass index [2.46 (0.56, 4.37) g/m2.7], E/A ratio [0.32 (0.13, 0.50)], tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion [0.14 (0.01, 0.26) cm], carotid intima-media thickness [0.024 (0.008, 0.040) mm], pulse wave velocity [0.40 (0.06, 0.75) m/s], cardiac index [-0.23 (-0.41, -0.06) L/min⋅m2], and heart rate [-7.23 (-10.16, -4.29) beats/min]. CONCLUSIONS: Steatosis was not associated with measures of cardiovascular structure and function nor with subclinical atherosclerosis after adjusting for known cardiovascular risk factors. Fibrosis, however, was associated with several cardiovascular measures, including indicators of subclinical atherosclerosis, even after full adjustment. Further follow-up will help determine whether cardiovascular health worsens later with steatosis alone.},

We hypothesized that offspring of HDP would have abnormalities in the retinal microvasculature and cardiac structure by midadulthood. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study included randomly selected children from 5 Finnish university cities. The mean age of participants was 40 years (range 34-49 years) at the time of retinal photography and cardiac assessment. Offspring born >/=37 weeks of gestation and appropriate for gestational age (n=1006) were included. Offspring of HDP had higher systolic blood pressure (beta=4.68, P<0.001), body mass index (beta=1.25, P=0.009), and waist circumference (beta=0.25, P=0.042), compared with offspring of normotensive pregnancies. However, no differences in fasting glucose, insulin, lipid profile, carotid intima media thickness, or brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation were shown. Retinal arteriolar diameters were narrower (beta=-0.43, P=0.009) and longer (beta=32.5, P=0.023) and the arteriolar length-to-diameter ratio was higher (beta=2.32, P=0.006) among offspring of HDP, after adjustment for age and sex. Left atrial volume indexed to body surface area (beta=1.34, P=0.040) was increased. Adjustment for the confounding effects of birth weight, body mass index, smoking and socioeconomic status, and the mediating effect of hypertension had little impact on the associations. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities of the retinal microvasculature and cardiac structure are seen in offspring of HDP in midadulthood. These findings may need to be considered in future primary prevention strategies of cardiovascular disease among offspring of HDP.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The present study examined the impact of BP from childhood to mid-adulthood on retinal microvascular architecture. METHODS: The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study included children aged 3-18 years, from five Finnish University cities, with participants chosen randomly from the national population registrar from those areas. The age of participants included in the current analyses in childhood (1980) ranged from three to nine years and in mid-adulthood (2011) ranged from 34 to 40 years (complete data n = 657). Measures of retinal microvasculature architecture measured in adulthood included diameters, tortuosity, lengths, and LDR. RESULTS: Regression analysis showed a strong negative association between childhood systolic BP and adult arteriolar diameter (standardized regression coefficient [beta] -0.300; p < 0.001) and with change in systolic BP from childhood to adulthood (beta = -0.249; p < 0.001). For arteriolar tortuosity, there was a strong positive association between childhood systolic BP and adult arteriolar tortuosity (beta = 0.154; p < 0.001) and no association with change in systolic BP from childhood to adulthood (beta = 0.072; p = 0.110). CONCLUSIONS: High BP in childhood and increased BP from childhood to adulthood impacts on retinal microvascular architecture in mid-adulthood.},

METHODS: The ALSPAC followed a cohort of children born in 1991-1992. The current study includes all children with retinal images acquired at the 12 years clinic and individual trajectories of PI from 0 to 2 years and BMI from 2 to 10 years. Retinal microvascular measures included retinal arteriolar and venular diameters. RESULTS: Children in this analysis had a birth weight of 3.5 +/- 0.4 kg, a PI of 26.2 +/- 2.4 kg/m(3) and a gestational age of 39.7 +/- 1.4 weeks (mean +/- SD). Analysis of growth trajectories showed that lower PI at birth was associated with narrower retinal arterioles. Higher PI at birth was associated with wider venular diameter, and a stronger positive association was evident between BMI change at 5-5.5 and 8.5-10 years with wider venular diameters. Current fat mass was also associated with wider venular diameters. CONCLUSIONS: Retinal arterioles and venules are differentially associated with growth in early life and childhood adiposity. Early adiposity may adversely affect the microcirculation, with important implications for cardiovascular risk in adulthood.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that an amlodipine-based regimen would have more favorable effects on left ventricular (LV) diastolic function. BACKGROUND: Different antihypertensive therapies may vary in their effect on LV diastolic function. METHODS: The HACVD (Hypertension Associated Cardiovascular Disease) substudy of ASCOT (Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial) collected detailed cardiovascular phenotypic data on a subset of 1,006 participants recruited from 2 centers (St. Mary's Hospital, London, and Beaumont Hospital, Dublin). Conventional and tissue Doppler echocardiography and measurement of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) were performed approximately 1 year after randomization to atenolol-based or amlodipine-based antihypertensive treatment to assess LV diastolic function. RESULTS: On-treatment blood pressure (BP) (mean +/- SD) was similar in both groups: atenolol-based regimen, systolic BP of 137 +/- 17 mm Hg, diastolic BP of 82 +/- 9 mm Hg; amlodipine-based regimen, systolic BP of 136 +/- 15 mm Hg, diastolic BP of 80 +/- 9 mm Hg. Ejection fraction did not differ between groups, but early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E'), a measure of diastolic relaxation, was lower in patients on the atenolol-based regimen: atenolol-based regimen, 7.9 +/- 1.8; amlodipine-based regimen, 8.8 +/- 2.0. A measure of left ventricular filling pressure, E/E', and BNP were significantly higher in patients on the atenolol-based regimen. Differences in E', E/E', and BNP remained significant after adjustment for age and sex. Further adjustment for systolic BP, LV mass index, and heart rate had no impact on differences in mean E' or BNP. The difference in E/E' was attenuated. CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving treatment with an amlodipine-based regimen had better diastolic function than patients treated with the atenolol-based regimen. Treatment-related differences in diastolic function were independent of BP reduction and other factors that are known to affect diastolic function.},

OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that small birth size may be associated with structural variations in the retinal vasculature in children. METHODS: The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children followed a cohort of children born in 1991-1992 from birth. The current study included the first 263 children who were systematically screened in the year-12 follow-up. Complete data were available for 166 children with a gestation of > or = 37 weeks. Retinal circulatory measures were evaluated, including retinal microvascular tortuosity and bifurcation optimality deviance, an indicator of abnormal endothelial function. RESULTS: Optimality deviance and retinal tortuosity were higher among those with lower birth weight. Linear regression modeling was used to assess the association of retinal microvascular measures with birth weight. The standardized beta coefficient between optimality deviance and birth weight was -.182 adjusted for gender and age in weeks; additional adjustment for systolic blood pressure and heart rate had little impact on the beta coefficient. A similar association was observed for retinal tortuosity. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that early life factors may have an important impact on retinal vascular structure, possibly through an adverse effect on endothelial function.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We studied the hemodynamic response to intravenous adenosine on calculation of fractional flow reserve (FFR). Intravenous adenosine is widely used to achieve conditions of stable hyperemia for measurement of FFR. However, intravenous adenosine affects both systemic and coronary vascular beds differentially. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 283 patients (310 coronary stenoses) underwent coronary angiography with FFR using intravenous adenosine 140 mcg/kg per minute via a central femoral vein. Offline analysis was performed to calculate aortic (Pa), distal intracoronary (Pd), and reservoir (Pr) pressure at baseline, peak, and stable hyperemia. Seven different hemodynamic patterns were observed according to Pa and Pd change at peak and stable hyperemia. The average time from baseline to stable hyperemia was 68.2+/-38.5 seconds, when both DeltaPa and DeltaPd were decreased (DeltaPa, -10.2+/-10.5 mm Hg; DeltaPd, -18.2+/-10.8 mm Hg; P<0.001 for both). The fall in Pa closely correlated with the reduction in peripheral Pr (DeltaPr, -12.9+/-15.7 mm Hg; P<0.001; r=0.9; P<0.001). DeltaPa and DeltaPd were closely related under conditions of peak (r=0.75; P<0.001) and stable hyperemia (r=0.83; P<0.001). On average, 56% (10.2 mm Hg) of the reduction in Pd was because of fall in Pa. FFR lesion classification changed in 9% using an FFR threshold of </=0.80 and 5.2% with FFR threshold <0.75 when comparing Pd/Pa at peak and stable hyperemia. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous adenosine results in variable changes in systemic blood pressure, which can lead to alterations in FFR lesion classification. Attention is required to ensure FFR is measured under conditions of stable hyperemia, although the FFR value at this point may be numerically higher.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate long-term prospective associations between a range of measurements of hypertensive status in midlife and cognitive impairment 20 years later. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Two areas (Southall and Brent) of northwest London. PARTICIPANTS: Survey samples of a multiethnic population (European, African Caribbean, South Asian) aged 40 to 67 were followed up 20 years later. MEASUREMENTS: Comprehensive cardiovascular assessments were performed at baseline, including measurements of resting blood pressure (BP) and, in a subsample, ambulatory BP. At follow-up, a battery of cognitive assessments was administered, and a composite outcome was derived, with impairment defined as the lowest 10% within each ethnic group. Logistic regression models were used to investigate associations with prior measures of hypertensive status. RESULTS: In 1,484 participants at follow-up, cognitive impairment showed significant U-shaped associations with baseline diastolic BP (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP; strongest for those aged >/= 50 at baseline), independent of a range of covariates, but no associations were found with systolic BP or pulse pressure. Cognitive impairment was also associated with antihypertensive medication use and higher evening ambulatory DBP at baseline. No substantial differences in strengths of association were found between ethnic groups. CONCLUSION: Low and high DBP and MAP were associated with cognitive impairment 20 years later. Higher evening DBP on ambulatory monitoring was also associated with greater risk.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Left ventricular mass (LVM) is an important predictor of cardiovascular risk. In adolescence, LVM is commonly indexed to height(2.7), although some evidence suggests that this may not fully account for sex differences. METHODS: We investigated appropriate allometric scaling of LVM to height, total lean mass, and body surface area, in a UK birth cohort of 2039 healthy adolescents (17+/-1 years). Allometric relationships were determined by linear regression stratified by sex, following log transformation of x and y variables [log(y)=a+bxlog(x)], b is the allometric exponent. RESULTS: Log (LVM) showed linear relationships with log(height) and log(lean mass). Biased estimates of slope resulted when the sexes were pooled. The exponents were lower than the conventional estimate of 2.7 for males (mean [95% CI]=1.66 [1.30-2.03]) and females (1.58 [1.27-1.90]). When LVM was indexed to lean mass, the exponent was 1.16 (1.05-1.26) for males and 1.07 (0.97-1.16) for females. When LVM was indexed to estimated body surface area, the exponent was 1.53 (1.40-1.66) for males and 1.34 (1.24-1.45) for females. CONCLUSIONS: Allometric exponents derived from pooled data, including men and women without adjustment for sex were biased, possibly due to sex differences in body composition. We suggest that when assessing LVM, clinicians should consider body size, body composition, sex, and age. Our observations may also have implications for the identification of young individuals with cardiac hypertrophy.},

The role of the endothelium in mediating relaxation to acetylcholine, the calcium ionophore A23187, vasoactive intestinal peptide and peptide histidine methionine was studied using isolated human blood vessels. 2. Segments of renal, colic, pulmonary, uterine, transverse cervical, brachial, coronary and coeliac branch arteries, and saphenous veins, were obtained from surgical resection material for use in tissue bath studies. 3. Acetylcholine or A23187 produced endothelium-dependent relaxation in isolated vessels from all vascular beds studied. Coronary arteries, however, differed in their response to acetylcholine which produced predominantly a contractile response, either alone or after initial relaxation. 4. Vasoactive intestinal peptide and peptide histidine methionine produced endothelium-dependent relaxation in coeliac branch arteries. However, these peptides relaxed isolated pulmonary arteries independently of endothelium. 5. Endothelium-dependent relaxation in response to acetylcholine and A23187 was antagonized by nordihydroguaretic acid, a lipoxygenase inhibitor, and methylene blue and haemoglobin, inhibitors of soluble guanylate cyclase. In these respects the endothelium-dependent responses of human arteries to acetylcholine and A23187 resemble those described in other species.},

   abstract = {Changes in the retinal microcirculation are associated with hypertension and predict cardiovascular mortality. There are few data describing the impact of antihypertensive therapy on retinal vascular changes. This substudy of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial compared the effects of an amlodipine-based regimen (373 patients) with an atenolol-based regimen (347 patients) on retinal microvascular measurements made from fundus photographs. The retinal photographs were taken at a stage in the trial when treatments were stable and blood pressure was well controlled. Amlodipine-based treatment was associated with a smaller arteriolar length:diameter ratio than atenolol-based treatment (13.32 [10.75 to 16.04] versus 14.12 [11.27 to 17.81], median [interquartile range]; P<0.01). The association remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, body mass index, smoking, and statin treatment. This effect appeared to be largely attributable to shorter retinal arteriolar segment lengths in the amlodipine-treated group and is best explained by the vasodilator effects of amlodipine causing the visible emergence of branching side vessels. Photographic assessment of the retinal vascular network may be a useful approach to evaluating microvascular structural responses in clinical trials of antihypertensive therapy.},

This has been shown in peripheral, splanchnic and coronary arteries. Agents which have been shown to promote the release of the human EDRF in these studies include acetylcholine (by a muscarinic mechanism), the calcium ionophore A23187, histamine and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). Nordihydroguaretic acid (NDGA), methylene blue and haemoglobin reverse the effect of the EDRF. The EDRF effect is calcium-dependent and is not inhibited by indomethacin. Atheromatous disease in coronary arteries impairs the response to agents which release EDRF; its relative absence in this circumstance may play a role in the phenomenon of coronary artery spasm. The possibility of a specific alpha 2-adrenoceptor mechanism for the release of EDRF was investigated. This does not appear to be present in the human vasculature.},

   abstract = {Current guideline criteria for surgical intervention in chronic aortic regurgitation (AR) rely on fixed thresholds of left ventricular size and ejection fraction, but these metrics may overlook early myocardial injury and under-appreciate patient heterogeneity, particularly in women and older adults. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) offers robust quantification of regurgitant volume, three-dimensional ventricular volumes, and both focal (late gadolinium enhancement) and diffuse (T1-mapping-derived extracellular volume) fibrosis. Observational studies have linked CMR-detected fibrosis to worse clinical outcomes and less favourable reverse remodelling after valve intervention, suggesting that fibrosis may mark the transition from compensated overload to irreversible myocardial damage. In this narrative review, we appraise the limitations of current guidelines, compare echocardiographic and CMR approaches to AR assessment, and summarize the evidence supporting myocardial fibrosis as a potential imaging biomarker for risk stratification. We discuss how integrating CMR-derived fibrosis metrics with volumetric and functional data could personalize timing of aortic valve intervention. While prospective studies are needed to validate fibrosis-guided decision-making, this evolving paradigm holds promise for earlier identification of patients at risk for irreversible myocardial injury, with the ultimate goal of preserving ventricular function and improving long-term outcomes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) predicts mortality from cardiovascular disease, ischaemic heart disease and stroke. However, a comparison of associations between PWV measured at different sites and atherosclerosis in coronary, carotid and femoral arteries has not been made. METHODS: In 159 men (ages 45-82 years) with and without known coronary artery disease, PWV measurements were made between carotid-femoral, carotid-radial and femoral-posterior tibial sites, using an ultrasound technique. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) scores were measured by multislice computed tomography. Carotid and femoral intima-media thickness (IMT) and presence of plaque were determined by ultrasound. Known coronary artery disease was confirmed by angiography. Participants were grouped into four categories of CAC score: 0-10, 11-100, 101-400, > 400 Hounsfield Units (HU). Measurements of blood pressure, heart rate and fasting bloods were made in all individuals. RESULTS: Carotid-femoral PWV correlated positively with CAC score and increased with incremental coronary calcification category (median carotid-femoral PWV 16.8 m/s in those with CAC score > 400 HU and 13.8 m/s in those with CAC score < 10 HU; P = 0.003). Carotid-femoral PWV also correlated with carotid and femoral IMT (P < 0.001, P = 0.004, respectively) and with carotid and femoral plaque (P = 0.001, P = 0.038, respectively). Increased carotid-femoral PWV also correlated with increasing age (P < 0.001), systolic blood pressure (P < 0.001), mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure (P < 0.001). Carotid-radial and femoral-posterior tibial PWV were not significantly associated with CAC score, carotid or femoral IMT or carotid plaque. CONCLUSIONS: Carotid-femoral PWV is a better indicator of atherosclerosis than either carotid-radial or femoral-posterior tibial PWV, and should be used preferentially in studies of atherosclerosis and in stratifying risk in clinical settings.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: To compare patterns of coronary artery disease in British South Asian and White European men. METHODS: 41 South Asian and 42 European men (mean age 64+/-9 years) with coronary artery disease were studied. All had similar symptoms. Vessel reference diameter and degree of stenosis were calculated using quantitative coronary angiography. Extent of atherosclerotic disease in the LAD was assessed using calcification scores (CAC) measured by multislice Computed Tomography. Fasting bloods and blood pressure were measured. The LAD was subdivided into four 2.5 cm segments for analysis. RESULTS: Most atherosclerosis occurred in the proximal LAD segment, South Asian men had more proximal LAD stenosis than European men (50% vs. 37%, p=0.036), but CAC scores were similar. South Asians with CAC scores in the lowest tertile (0-22 HU), had significantly narrower LAD diameters than Europeans (2.8 mm vs. 3.8 mm, p=0.004, adjusted for body surface area and age). This ethnic difference was not explained by measured risk factors, including diabetes. In contrast, ethnic differences in LAD diameter were abolished in the upper tertiles of CAC scores (23-2416 HU) (South Asians: 3.0 mm, Europeans: 3.1 mm, p=0.6). Calcification scores were negatively correlated with LAD diameter in Europeans (rho=-0.38, p=0.016) but not in South Asians (rho=-0.06, p=0.72). CONCLUSIONS: Increased LAD stenosis, despite equivalent levels of calcified disease, in South Asians is attributable to narrower arteries. Reduced LAD diameter is associated with advanced disease in Europeans but not in South Asians, indicative of ethnic differences in vascular remodelling.},

   abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: People of African origin have increased risk of stroke and retinal microvascular disease compared with populations of European origin. We compared quantitative measures of retinal microvasculature in British white Europeans and African Caribbeans. METHODS: Population-based study of 215 (45% male) British African-Caribbean migrants and 323 (48% male) white Europeans aged 40-69 years. Digitised retinal images were analysed using a validated semi-automated system. RESULTS: Arteriolar optimality deviation, an indicator of endothelial dysfunction, was greater in African Caribbeans (age- and sex-adjusted means [95% CIs]: 0.06 [0.05-0.06] vs 0.04 [0.04-0.05], p = 0.004); this was unexplained by conventional risk factors. Arteriolar diameters were narrower in African Caribbeans (age- and sex-adjusted means [95% CIs]: 18.4 [18.1-18.6] vs 17.9 [17.6-18.2], p = 0.011). These ethnic differences in diameters were attenuated on adjustment for systolic BP (SBP) (adjusted means: 18.2 vs 18.1, p = 0.31). However, there was a significant interaction (p = 0.011) between diabetes and SBP, such that SBP was strongly associated with arteriolar diameter in people without diabetes, but not in those with diabetes (adjusted beta-coefficients for SBP: Europeans: -0.42, p = 0.002 vs 0.17, p = 0.69, African Caribbeans: -0.35, p = 0.023 vs 0.01, p = 0.96). Other measures of retinal vasculature did not differ by ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: British African Caribbeans appear to have poorer retinal arteriolar endothelial function than white Europeans. Higher BPs explained the narrower arterioles in African Caribbeans; however, patterns of association between arteriolar narrowing and BP suggest the possibility that cerebral autoregulation and/or remodelling might be adversely affected by diabetes in both ethnic groups.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent of, and reasons for, ethnic differences in type 2 diabetes incidence in the U.K. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Population-based triethnic cohort. Participants were without diabetes, aged 40-69 at baseline (1989-1991), and followed-up for 20 years. Baseline measurements included fasting and postglucose bloods, anthropometry, and lifestyle questionnaire. Incident diabetes was identified from medical records and participant recall. Ethnic differences in diabetes incidence were examined using competing risks regression. RESULTS: Incident diabetes was identified in 196 of 1,354 (14%) Europeans, 282 of 839 (34%) Indian Asians, and 100 of 335 (30%) African Caribbeans. All Indian Asians and African Caribbeans were first-generation migrants. Compared with Europeans, age-adjusted subhazard ratios (SHRs [95% CI]) for men and women, respectively, were 2.88 (95%, 2.36-3.53; P < 0.001) and 1.91 (1.18-3.10; P = 0.008) in Indian Asians, and 2.23 (1.64-3.03; P < 0.001) and 2.51 (1.63-3.87; P < 0.001) in African Caribbeans. Differences in baseline insulin resistance and truncal obesity largely attenuated the ethnic minority excess in women (adjusted SHRs: Indian Asians 0.77 [0.49-1.42]; P = 0.3; African Caribbeans 1.48 [0.89-2.45]; P = 0.13), but not in men (adjusted SHRs: Indian Asians 1.98 [1.52-2.58]; P < 0.001 and African Caribbeans, 2.05 [1.46-2.89; P < 0.001]). CONCLUSIONS: Insulin resistance and truncal obesity account for the twofold excess incidence of diabetes in Indian Asian and African Caribbean women, but not men. Explanations for the excess diabetes risk in ethnic minority men remains unclear. Further study requires more precise measures of conventional risk factors and identification of novel risk factors.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine whether ethnic differences in diabetes, dyslipidemia, and ectopic fat deposition account for ethnic differences in incident cardiovascular disease. BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease risks are elevated in South Asians and are lower in African Caribbeans compared with Europeans. These ethnic differences map to lipid patterns and ectopic fat deposition. METHODS: Cardiovascular risk factors were assessed in 2,049 Europeans, 1,517 South Asians, and 630 African Caribbeans from 1988 through 1991 (mean age: 52.4 +/- 6.9 years). Fatal and nonfatal events were captured over a median 20.5-year follow-up. Subhazard ratios (SHR) were calculated using competing risks regression. RESULTS: Baseline diabetes prevalence was more than 3 times greater in South Asians and African Caribbeans than in Europeans. South Asians were more and African Caribbeans were less centrally obese and dyslipidemic than Europeans. Compared with Europeans, coronary heart disease incidence was greater in South Asians and less in African Caribbeans. The age- and sex-adjusted South Asian versus European SHR was 1.70 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.52 to 1.91, p < 0.001) and remained significant (1.45, 95% CI: 1.28 to 1.64, p < 0.001) when adjusted for waist-to-hip ratio. The African Caribbean versus European age- and sex-adjusted SHR of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.52 to 0.79, p < 0.001) remained significant when adjusted for high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.74, 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.92, p = 0.008). Compared with Europeans, South Asians and African Caribbeans experienced more strokes (age- and sex-adjusted SHR: 1.45 [95% CI: 1.17 to 1.80, p = 0.001] and 1.50 [95% CI: 1.13 to 2.00, p = 0.005], respectively), and this differential was more marked in those with diabetes (age-adjusted SHR: 1.97 [95% CI: 1.16 to 3.35, p = 0.038 for interaction] and 2.21 [95% CI: 1.14 to 4.30, p = 0.019 for interaction]). CONCLUSIONS: Ethnic differences in measured metabolic risk factors did not explain differences in coronary heart disease incidence. The apparently greater association between diabetes and stroke risk in South Asians and African Caribbeans compared with Europeans merits further study.},

   abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: South Asian individuals have an increased risk of diabetes compared with Europeans that is unexplained by obesity and traditional or established metabolic measures. Circulating amino acids (AAs) may provide additional explanatory insights. In a unique cohort of European and South Asian men, we compared cross-sectional associations between AAs, metabolic and obesity traits, and longitudinal associations with incident diabetes. METHODS: Nuclear magnetic spectroscopy was used to measure the baseline (1988-1991) levels of nine AAs in serum samples from a British population-based cohort of 1,279 European and 1,007 South Asian non-diabetic men aged 40-69 years. Follow-up was complete for 19 years in 801 European and 643 South Asian participants. RESULTS: The serum concentrations of isoleucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine and alanine were significantly higher in South Asian men, while cross-sectional correlations of AAs with glycaemia and insulin resistance were similar in the two ethnic groups. However, most AAs were less strongly correlated with measures of obesity in the South Asian participants. Diabetes developed in 227 (35%) South Asian and 113 (14%) European men. Stronger adverse associations were observed between branched chain and aromatic AAs and incident diabetes in South Asian men. Tyrosine was a particularly strong predictor of incident diabetes in South Asian individuals, even after adjustment for metabolic risk factors, including obesity and insulin resistance (adjusted OR for a 1 SD increment, 1.47, 95% CI 1.17,1.85, p = 0.001) compared with Europeans (OR 1.10, 0.87, 1.39, p = 0.4; p = 0.045 for ethnicity x tyrosine interaction). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Branched chain and aromatic AAs, particularly tyrosine, may be a focus for identifying novel aetiological mechanisms and potential treatment targets for diabetes in South Asian populations and may contribute to their excess risk of diabetes.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate QRISK2 and Framingham cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk scores in a tri-ethnic U.K. population. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: West London. PARTICIPANTS: Randomly selected from primary care lists. Follow-up data were available for 87% of traced participants, comprising 1866 white Europeans, 1377 South Asians, and 578 African Caribbeans, aged 40-69 years at baseline (1998-1991). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: First CVD events: myocardial infarction, coronary revascularisation, angina, transient ischaemic attack or stroke reported by participant, primary care or hospital records or death certificate. RESULTS: During follow-up, 387 CVD events occurred in men (14%) and 78 in women (8%). Both scores underestimated risk in European and South Asian women (ratio of predicted to observed risk: European women: QRISK2: 0.73, Framingham: 0.73; South Asian women: QRISK2: 0.52, Framingham: 0.43). In African Caribbeans, Framingham over-predicted in men and women and QRISK2 over-predicted in women. Framingham classified 28% of participants as high risk, predicting 54% of all such events. QRISK2 classified 19% as high risk, predicting 42% of all such events. Both scores performed poorly in identifying high risk African Caribbeans; QRISK2 and Framingham identified as high risk only 10% and 24% of those who experienced events. CONCLUSIONS: Neither score performed consistently well in all ethnic groups. Further validation of QRISK2 in other multi-ethnic datasets, and better methods for identifying high risk African Caribbeans and South Asian women, are required.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Conventional definitions of obesity, e.g. body mass index (BMI) >/= 30 kg/m(2) or waist circumference cut-points of 102 cm (men) and 88 cm (women), may underestimate metabolic risk in non-Europeans. We prospectively identified equivalent ethnicity-specific obesity cut-points for the estimation of diabetes risk in British South Asians, African-Caribbeans and Europeans. METHODS: We studied a population-based cohort from London, UK (1356 Europeans, 842 South Asians, 335 African-Caribbeans) who were aged 40-69 years at baseline (1988-1991), when they underwent anthropometry, fasting and post-load (75 g oral glucose tolerance test) blood tests. Incident Type 2 diabetes was identified from primary care records, participant recall and/or follow-up biochemistry. Ethnicity-specific obesity cut-points in association with diabetes incidence were estimated using negative binomial regression. RESULTS: Diabetes incidence rates (per 1000 person years) at a median follow-up of 19 years were 20.8 (95% CI: 18.4, 23.6) and 12.0 (8.3, 17.2) in South Asian men and women, 16.5 (12.7, 21.4) and 17.5 (13.0, 23.7) in African-Caribbean men and women, and 7.4 (6.3, 8.7), and 7.2 (5.3, 9.8) in European men and women. For incidence rates equivalent to those at a BMI of 30 kg/m(2) in European men and women, age- and sex-adjusted cut-points were: South Asians, 25.2 (23.4, 26.6) kg/m(2); and African-Caribbeans, 27.2 (25.2, 28.6) kg/m(2). For South Asian and African-Caribbean men, respectively, waist circumference cut-points of 90.4 (85.0, 94.5) and 90.6 (85.0, 94.5) cm were equivalent to a value of 102 cm in European men. Waist circumference cut-points of 84.0 (74.0, 90.0) cm in South Asian women and 81.2 (71.4, 87.4) cm in African-Caribbean women were equivalent to a value of 88 cm in European women. CONCLUSIONS: In prospective analyses, British South Asians and African-Caribbeans had equivalent diabetes incidence rates at substantially lower obesity levels than the conventional European cut-points.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of yoga practice on subclinical cardiovascular measures, risk factors and neuro-endocrine pathways in patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation (CR) following acute coronary events. DESIGN: 3-month, two-arm (yoga +usual care vs usual care alone) parallel randomised mechanistic study. SETTING: One general hospital and two primary care CR centres in London. Assessments were conducted at Imperial College London. PARTICIPANTS: 80 participants, aged 35-80 years (68% men, 60% South Asian) referred to CR programmes 2012-2014. INTERVENTION: A certified yoga teacher conducted yoga classes which included exercises in stretching, breathing, healing imagery and deep relaxation. It was pre-specified that at least 18 yoga classes were attended for inclusion in analysis. Participants and partners in both groups were invited to attend weekly a 6- to 12-week local standard UK National Health Service CR programme. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (i) Estimated left ventricular filling pressure (E/e'), (ii) distance walked, fatigue and breathlessness in a 6 min walk test, (iii) blood pressure, heart rate and estimated peak VO2 following a 3 min step-test. Effects on the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, autonomic function, body fat, blood lipids and glucose, stress and general health were also explored. RESULTS: 25 participants in the yoga + usual care group and 35 participants in the usual care group completed the study. Following the 3-month intervention period, E/e' was not improved by yoga (E/e': between-group difference: yoga minus usual care:-0.40 (-1.38, 0.58). Exercise testing and secondary outcomes also showed no benefits of yoga. CONCLUSIONS: In this small UK-based randomised mechanistic study, with 60 completing participants (of whom 25 were in the yoga + usual care group), we found no discernible improvement associated with the addition of a structured 3-month yoga intervention to usual CR care in key cardiovascular and neuroendocrine measures shown to be responsive to yoga in previous mechanistic studies.

   abstract = {AIM: To determine whether metformin's effects on carotid artery intima-media thickness (cIMT) in type 1 diabetes differ according to smoking status. METHODS: Regression model effect estimates for the effect of metformin versus placebo (double-blind) on carotid IMT were calculated as a subgroup analysis of the REMOVAL trial. RESULTS: In 428 randomized participants (227 never-smokers, 201 ever-smokers), averaged mean carotid IMT progression (per year) was reduced by metformin versus placebo in never-smokers (-0.012 mm, 95% CI -0.021 to -0.002; p = .0137) but not in ever-smokers (0.003 mm, 95% CI -0.008 to 0.014; p = .5767); and similarly in non-current smokers (-0.008 mm, 95% CI -0.015 to -0.00001; p = .0497) but not in current smokers (0.013 mm, 95% CI -0.007 to 0.032; p = .1887). Three-way interaction terms (treatment*time*smoking status) were significant for never versus ever smoking (p = .0373, prespecified) and non-current versus current smoking (p = .0496, exploratory). Averaged maximal carotid IMT progression (per year) was reduced by metformin versus placebo in never-smokers (-0.020 mm, 95% CI -0.034 to -0.006; p = .0067) but not in ever-smokers (-0.006 mm, 95% CI -0.020 to 0.008; p = .4067), although this analysis was not supported by a significant three-way interaction term. CONCLUSIONS: This subgroup analysis of the REMOVAL trial provides additional support for a potentially wider role of adjunct metformin therapy in cardiovascular risk management in type 1 diabetes, particularly for individuals who have never smoked cigarettes.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Maternal hemodynamics in pregnancy is associated with fetal growth and birth weight, which in turn are associated with offspring cardiovascular disease later in life. The aim of this study was to quantify the extent to which birth weight is associated with cardiac structure and function in adolescence. METHODS: A subset of offspring (n = 1964; 55% female) of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children were examined with echocardiography at a mean age of 17.7 (SD, 0.3) years. The associations of birth-weight Z-score for sex and gestational age with cardiac structure (assessed by relative wall thickness, left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and left atrial diameter index), systolic function (assessed by ejection fraction and left ventricular wall velocity) and diastolic function (assessed by early/late mitral inflow velocity (E/A) and early mitral inflow velocity/mitral annular early diastolic velocity (E/e')) were evaluated. Linear regression models were adjusted for several potential confounders, including maternal prepregnancy body mass index, age, level of education and smoking during pregnancy. RESULTS: Higher birth-weight Z-score was associated with lower E/A (mean difference, -0.024; 95% CI, -0.043 to -0.005) and E/e' (mean difference, -0.05; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.001) and higher LVMI (mean difference, 0.38 g/m(2.7) ; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.67). There was no or inconsistent evidence of associations of birth-weight Z-score with relative wall thickness, left atrial diameter and measurements of systolic function. Further analyses suggested that the association between birth-weight Z-score and LVMI was driven mainly by an association observed in participants born small-for-gestational age and it did not persist when risk factors in adolescence were accounted for. CONCLUSIONS: Higher birth weight adjusted for sex and gestational age was associated with differences in measures of diastolic function in adolescence, but the observed associations were small. It remains to be determined the extent to which these associations translate into increased susceptibility to cardiovascular disease later in life. (c) 2018 The Authors.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fetal exposure to preeclampsia is associated with higher blood pressure and later risk of stroke. We aimed to investigate the associations of maternal preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and maternal blood pressure change in pregnancy with offspring cardiac structure and function in adolescence. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using data from a prospective birth cohort study, we included offspring who underwent echocardiography (mean age, 17.7 years; SD, 0.3; N=1592). We examined whether hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were associated with offspring cardiac structure and systolic/diastolic function using linear regression. Using multilevel linear spline models (measurement occasions within women), we also investigated whether rate of maternal systolic/diastolic blood pressure change during pregnancy (weeks 8-18, 18-30, 30-36, and 36 or more) were associated with offspring outcomes. Main models were typically adjusted for maternal age, offspring age and sex, prepregnancy body mass index, parity, glycosuria/diabetes mellitus, education, and maternal smoking. Exposure to maternal preeclampsia (0.025; 95% CI, 0.008-0.043) and gestational hypertension (0.010; 0.002-0.017) were associated with greater relative wall thickness. Furthermore, preeclampsia was also associated with a smaller left ventricular end-diastolic volume (-9.0 mL; -15 to -3.1). No associations were found between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and offspring cardiac function. Positive rate of maternal systolic blood pressure change during weeks 8 to 18 was associated with greater offspring left ventricular end-diastolic volume, left ventricular mass indexed to height2.7, and E/A. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent offspring exposed to maternal preeclampsia had greater relative wall thickness and reduced left ventricular end-diastolic volume, which could be early signs of concentric remodeling and affect future cardiac function as well as risk of cardiovascular disease.},

Both the ATP-site competitors (genistein and its inactive analogue, daidzein) and the substrate-site competitors (tyrphostins A-23, A-47 and the inactive analogue, A-1) reversibly inhibited noradrenaline (NA, (10 microM)) and KCl (125 mM) induced contractions, concentration-dependently. Genistein was slightly but significantly more potent than daidzein; the tyrphostins were all less potent than genistein, and there were no significant differences between the individual potencies. The tyrosine kinase substrate-site inhibitor bis-tyrphostin had no inhibitory effect. 3. Genistein, daidzein, A-23 and A-47 each suppressed the contraction induced by Ca2+ (1 microM) in alpha-toxin permeabilized arteries. A-1 and bis-tyrphostin had little or no effect on contraction of the permeabilized arteries. 4. Genistein was significantly more potent than daidzein with respect to inhibition of the contraction induced by 200 nM Ca2+ in the presence of NA (100 microM) and GTP (3 microM). The effect of A-23, A-47, A-1 and bis-tyrphostin was similar in permeabilized arteries activated with Ca2+ (200 nM) + NA (100 microM) + GTP (3 microM) and permeabilized arteries activated with 1 microM Ca2+. 5. Genistein (30 microM) reduced the fura-2 measured intracellular calcium activity ([Ca2+]j) in arteries stimulated with NA but had no effect on [Ca2+]i in arteries stimulated with KCl (125 mM).6. The potent effect of the TKIs in this study is consistent with a role for tyrosine kinases in the mechanisms which regulate both cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels and the effect of Ca2+ on the contractile apparatus in smooth muscle cells in resistance arteries. However, the results must be interpreted cautiously because the enzyme inhibitors may have a poor specificity in intact tissues and because the presumed inactive analogues had potent effects.},

   abstract = {Carriage of the ancestral APOE ε4 allele confers a risk of developing Alzheimer's and coronary artery disease, but its persistence in human populations also suggests some potential survival advantages. To date it remains unclear whether APOE ε4 carriage independently associates with a better or worse long-term cardiac phenotype.Using data from the 1946 National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) birth cohort, we investigated whether APOE ε4 carriage associates with adverse or beneficial left ventricular (LV) size and function parameters by echocardiography in older age.Based on the presence or absence of APOE ε4, genotypes were divided into: non-APOE ε4 (ε2ε2, ε2ε3, ε3ε3), heterozygous-APOE ε4 (ε2ε4 and ε3ε4) and homozygous-APOE ε4 (ε4ε4). Echocardiographic data at 60–64 years included: left ventricular ejection fraction (LV EF), E/e', systolic and diastolic LV posterior wall and interventricular septal thickness (LVPWTs/d, IVSs/d), and body-surface area indexed LV mass (LVmassi) and myocardial contraction fraction (MCFi). Generalized linear models explored associations between APOE ε4 genotypes as exposures and echocardiographic biomarkers as outcomes. As a combination of gene variants, APOE ε genotype is expected to be an instrumental variable and therefore unconfounded. Thus, Model 1 was unadjusted. To obtain more precise regression estimates, Model 2 was adjusted for factors associated with the outcome, namely sex and socio-economic position (SEP). To explore the mechanistic pathway downstream of APOE ε genotype but upstream of the echocardiographic outcomes, subsequent models were adjusted for mediators as follows: Model 3 for body mass index, Model 4 for the presence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), Model 5 for diabetes, Model 6 for high cholesterol and Model 7 for hypertension.1464 participants were included. Compared to non-APOE ε4 and homozygous groups, heterozygous-APOE ε4 individuals had similar cardiac phenotypes in terms of EF, E/e', LVPWTs/d, IVSs/d and LVmassi but had a 7% higher MCFi 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1%-13%, p=0.017) which persisted even after adjustment for sex and SEP (95% CI 1%-12%, p=0.026) that was attenuated to 6% after adjustment for CVD (95% CI 0–13% p=0.050) and hypertension (95% CI 1–13% p=0.022).The heterozygous-APOE ε4 state associates with improved myocardial shortening in older age resulting in greater LV stroke volume generation per 1 mL of myocardium. As we found no association between APOE ε4 carriage and LVPWTs/d, IVSs/d or LVmassi, MCFi enhancement may be mediated by improved myocardial energetics and contractility, with calcium and androgens potentially implicated, rather than through pathological ventricular thickening. Although a dose relationship is normally expected with ε4 carriage, any benefit from increased energetics and contractility is likely to be counterbalances by the higher risk of CVD and cardiovascular risk factors.Type of funding sources: Public grant(s) – National budget only.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lamin (LMNA) heart disease is a lethal form of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). OBJECTIVES: The authors explored its cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) phenotype to discover prognostically useful and subclinical biomarkers. METHODS: This prospective multicenter study recruited 4 groups: LMNA carriers with left ventricular ejection fraction >/=55% (Lamin+EF), LMNA carriers with left ventricular ejection fraction <50% (Lamin-EF), individuals with DCM with wild-type LMNA (DCMwt), and healthy volunteers. Phantom-calibrated CMR comprising cines, late gadolinium enhancement, and multiparametric mapping was undertaken. Left ventricular shapes were reconstructed using generalized Procrustes analysis. Serum biomarkers were collected at the time of CMR. Using a major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) outcome of cardiovascular death, life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia, heart transplantation, or atrioventricular block requiring pacing, we explored the prognostic value of CMR metrics using Cox regression. RESULTS: A total of 187 individuals were recruited (50% male): 29 with Lamin+EF (38 +/- 14 years), 38 with Lamin-EF (45 +/- 17 years), 73 with DCMwt (45 +/- 15 years), and 47 healthy volunteers (44 +/- 20 years). Compared to HVs, Lamin+EF had longer phantom-normalized T(2) by 10 (95% CI: 2-20), higher ECV by 3% (95% CI: 1%-6%), and worse myocardial dynamics. Compared with DCMwt participants, Lamin+EF participants had better myocardial dynamics, higher phantom-normalized T(2) (20 vs 12; P = 0.010), higher serum troponin (27 ng/L vs 5 ng/L; P < 0.001), and higher C-reactive protein (8 mg/L vs 3 mg/L; P = 0.021). Lamin-EF participants had similar myocardial dynamics but higher serum troponin (13 ng/L vs 5 ng/L; P < 0.001), higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (668 pg/mL vs 228 pg/mL; P = 0.025), longer phantom-normalized T(2) by 16 (95% CI: 1-31), and higher extracellular volume by 5% (95% CI: 1%-9%) than DCMwt participants. Over 4 years, 21% of lamin and 6% of DCMwt participants experienced MACE (P < 0.001). In lamin participants, each 1% increase in global late gadolinium enhancement and each 1% decrease in Procrustes trajectory sizes associated with HRs for MACE of 1.15 (95% CI: 1.02-1.30) and 1.01 (95% CI: 1.01-1.02), respectively (both P </= 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: The CMR phenotype of LMNA carriers with preserved left ventricular systolic function consists of longer T(2), higher serum troponin levels, higher extracellular volume, and impaired strain. CMR-derived focal fibrosis and strain biomarkers are prognostic, and future studies should explore their added clinical utility beyond the currently available MACE risk prediction tools.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aircraft noise is a growing concern for communities living near airports. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the impact of aircraft noise on heart structure and function. METHODS: Nighttime aircraft noise levels (L(night)) and weighted 24-hour day-evening-night aircraft noise levels (L(den)) were provided by the UK Civil Aviation Authority for 2011. Health data came from UK Biobank (UKB) participants living near 4 UK major airports (London Heathrow, London Gatwick, Manchester, and Birmingham) who had cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging starting from 2014 and self-reported no hearing difficulties. Generalized linear models investigated the associations between aircraft noise exposure and CMR metrics (derived using a validated convolutional neural network to ensure consistent image segmentations), after adjustment for demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and environmental confounders. Mediation by cardiovascular risk factors was also explored. Downstream associations between CMR metrics and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were tested in a separate prospective UKB subcohort (n = 21,360), to understand the potential clinical impact of any noise-associated heart remodeling. RESULTS: Of the 3,635 UKB participants included, 3% experienced higher L(night) (>/=45 dB) and 8% higher L(den) (>/=50 dB). Participants exposed to higher L(night) had 7% (95% CI: 4%-10%) greater left ventricular (LV) mass and 4% (95% CI: 2%-5%) thicker LV walls with a normal septal-to-lateral wall thickness ratio. This concentric LV remodeling is relevant because a 7% greater LV mass associates with a 32% greater risk of MACE. They also had worse LV myocardial dynamics (eg, an 8% [95% CI: 4%-12%] lower global circumferential strain which associates with a 27% higher risk of MACE). Overall, a hypothetical individual experiencing the typical CMR abnormalities associated with a higher L(night) exposure may have a 4 times higher risk of MACE. Findings were clearest for L(night) but were broadly similar in analyses using L(den). Body mass index and hypertension appeared to mediate 10% to 50% of the observed associations. Participants who did not move home during follow-up and were continuously exposed to higher aircraft noise levels had the worst CMR phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Higher aircraft noise exposure associates with adverse LV remodeling, potentially due to noise increasing the risk of obesity and hypertension. Findings are consistent with the existing literature on aircraft noise and cardiovascular disease, and need to be considered by policymakers and the aviation industry.},

   abstract = {A frailty index (FI) counts health deficit accumulation. Besides traditional risk factors, it is unknown whether the health deficit burden is related to the appearance of cardiovascular disease. In order to answer this question, the same multidimensional FI looking at 45-health deficits was serially calculated per participant at 4 time periods (0-16, 19-44, 45-54 and 60-64 years) using data from the 1946 Medical Research Council (MRC) British National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD)-the world's longest running longitudinal birth cohort with continuous follow-up. From these the mean and total FI for the life-course, and the step change in deficit accumulation from one time period to another was derived. Echocardiographic data at 60-64 years provided: ejection fraction (EF), left ventricular mass indexed to body surface area (LVmassi, BSA), myocardial contraction fraction indexed to BSA (MCFi) and E/e'. Generalized linear models assessed the association between FIs and echocardiographic parameters after adjustment for relevant covariates. 1375 participants were included. For each single new deficit accumulated at any one of the 4 time periods, LVmassi increased by 0.91-1.44% (p < 0.013), while MCFi decreased by 0.6-1.02% (p < 0.05). A unit increase in FI at age 45-54 and 60-64, decreased EF by 11-12% (p < 0.013). A single health deficit step change occurring between 60 and 64 years and one of the earlier time periods, translated into higher odds (2.1-78.5, p < 0.020) of elevated LV filling pressure. Thus, the accumulation of health deficits at any time period of the life-course associates with a maladaptive cardiac phenotype in older age, dominated by myocardial hypertrophy and poorer function.},

   abstract = {Background This study explored the association between childhood bradycardia and later-life cardiac phenotype using longitudinal data from the 1946 National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) birth cohort. Methods and Results Resting heart rate was recorded at 6 and 7 years of age to provide the bradycardia exposure defined as a childhood resting heart rate <75 bpm. Three outcomes were studied: (1) echocardiographic data at 60 to 64 years of age, consisting of ejection fraction, left ventricular mass index, myocardial contraction fraction index, and E/e'; (2) electrocardiographic evidence of atrioventricular or ventricular conduction defects by 60 to 64 years of age; and (3) all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Generalized linear models or Cox regression models were used, and adjustment was made for relevant demographic and health-related covariates, and for multiple testing. Mixed generalized linear models and fractional polynomials were used as sensitivity analyses. One in 3 older adults with atrioventricular conduction defects had been bradycardic in childhood, with defects being serious (Mobitz type II second-degree atrioventricular block or higher) in 12%. In fully adjusted models, childhood bradycardia was associated with 2.91 higher odds of atrioventricular conduction defects (95% CI, 1.59-5.31; P=0.0005). Associations persisted in random coefficients mixed generalized linear models (odds ratio, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.01-4.31). Fractional polynomials confirmed a linear association between the log odds of atrioventricular conduction defects at 60 to 64 years of age and resting heart rate at 7 years of age. There was no association between bradycardia in childhood and mortality outcomes or with echocardiographic parameters and ventricular conduction defects in older age. Conclusions Longitudinal birth cohort data indicate that childhood bradycardia trebles the odds of having atrioventricular conduction defects in older age, 88% of which are benign. In addition, it does not influence mortality or heart size and function. Future research should concentrate on identifying children at risk.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although APOE epsilon4 allele carriage confers a risk for coronary artery disease, its persistence in humans might be explained by certain survival advantages (antagonistic pleiotropy). METHODS: Combining data from ~ 37,000 persons from three older age British cohorts (1946 National Survey of Health and Development [NSHD], Southall and Brent Revised [SABRE], and UK Biobank) and one younger age cohort (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children [ALSPAC]), we explored whether APOE epsilon4 carriage associates with beneficial or unfavorable left ventricular (LV) structural and functional metrics by echocardiography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). RESULTS: Compared to the non-APOE epsilon4 group, APOE epsilon4 carriers had similar cardiac phenotypes in terms of LV ejection fraction, E/e', posterior wall and interventricular septal thickness, and LV mass. However, they had improved myocardial performance resulting in greater LV stroke volume generation per 1 mL of myocardium (higher myocardial contraction fraction). In NSHD (n = 1467) and SABRE (n = 1187), epsilon4 carriers had a 4% higher MCF (95% CI 1-7%, p = 0.016) using echocardiography. Using CMR data, in UK Biobank (n = 32,972), epsilon4 carriers had a 1% higher MCF 95% (CI 0-1%, p = 0.020) with a dose-response relationship based on the number of epsilon4 alleles. In addition, UK Biobank epsilon4 carriers also had more favorable radial and longitudinal strain rates compared to non APOE epsilon4 carriers. In ALSPAC (n = 1397), APOE epsilon4 carriers aged < 24 years had a 2% higher MCF (95% CI 0-5%, p = 0.059). CONCLUSIONS: By triangulating results in four independent cohorts, across imaging modalities (echocardiography and CMR), and in ~ 37,000 individuals, our results point towards an association between epsilon4 carriage and improved cardiac performance in terms of LV MCF. This potentially favorable cardiac phenotype adds to the growing number of reported survival advantages attributed to the pleiotropic effects APOE epsilon4 carriage that might collectively explain its persistence in human populations.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Access to health services and adequate care is influenced by sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic position (SEP) and the burden of comorbidities. Our study aimed to assess whether the COVID-19 pandemic further deepened these already existing health inequalities. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Data were collected from five longitudinal age-homogenous British cohorts (born in 2000-2002, 1989-1990, 1970, 1958 and 1946). PARTICIPANTS: A web survey was sent to the cohorts. Anybody who responded to the survey was included, resulting in 14 891 eligible participants. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURED: The survey provided data on cancelled surgical or medical appointments, and the number of care hours received in a week during the first UK COVID-19 national lockdown. INTERVENTIONS: Using binary or ordered logistic regression, we evaluated whether these outcomes differed by sex, ethnicity, SEP and having a chronic illness. Adjustment was made for study design, non-response weights, psychological distress, presence of children or adolescents in the household, COVID-19 infection, key worker status, and whether participants had received a shielding letter. Meta-analyses were performed across the cohorts, and meta-regression was used to evaluate the effect of age as a moderator. RESULTS: Women (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.55) and those with a chronic illness (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.65 to 2.05) experienced significantly more cancellations during lockdown (all p<0.0001). Ethnic minorities and those with a chronic illness required a higher number of care hours during the lockdown (both OR approximately 2.00, all p<0.002). SEP was not associated with cancellation or care hours. Age was not independently associated with either outcome in the meta-regression. CONCLUSION: The UK government's lockdown approach during the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have deepened existing health inequalities, impacting predominantly women, ethnic minorities and those with chronic illnesses. Public health authorities need to implement urgent policies to ensure equitable access to health and care for all in preparation for a fourthwave.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Key workers played a pivotal role during the national lockdown in the UK's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although protective measures have been taken, the impact of the pandemic on key workers is yet to be fully elucidated. METHODS: Participants were from four longitudinal age-homogeneous British cohorts (born in 2001, 1990, 1970 and 1958). A web-based survey provided outcome data during the first UK national lockdown (May 2020) on COVID-19 infection status, changes in financial situation, trust in government, conflict with people around, household composition, psychological distress, alcohol consumption, smoking and sleep duration. Generalised linear models with logit link assessed the association between being a key worker and the above outcomes. Adjustment was made for cohort design, non-response, sex, ethnicity, adult socioeconomic position (SEP), childhood SEP, the presence of a chronic illness and receipt of a shielding letter. Meta-analyses were performed across the cohorts. FINDINGS: 13 736 participants were included. During lockdown, being a key worker was associated with increased chances of being infected with COVID-19 (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.68) and experiencing conflict with people around (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.37). However, key workers were less likely to be worse off financially (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.65), to consume more alcohol (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.98) or to smoke more (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.80) during lockdown. Interestingly, being a key worker was not associated with psychological distress (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.05). INTERPRETATION: Being a key worker during the first UK COVID-19 lockdown was a double-edged sword, with both benefits and downsides. The UK government had the basic duty to protect its key workers from SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it may have failed to do so, and there is an urgent need to rectify this in light of the ongoing third wave.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to develop a fully subject-specific model of the right coronary artery (RCA), including dynamic vessel motion, for computational analysis to assess the effects of cardiac-induced motion on hemodynamics and resulting wall shear stress (WSS). Vascular geometries were acquired in the right coronary artery (RCA) of a healthy volunteer using a navigator-gated interleaved spiral sequence at 14 time points during the cardiac cycle. A high temporal resolution velocity waveform was also acquired in the proximal region. Cardiac-induced dynamic vessel motion was calculated by interpolating the geometries with an active contour model and a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation with fully subject-specific information was carried out using this model. The results showed the expected variation of vessel radius and curvature throughout the cardiac cycle, and also revealed that dynamic motion of the right coronary artery consequent to cardiac motion had significant effects on instantaneous WSS and oscillatory shear index. Subject-specific MRI-based CFD is feasible and, if scan duration could be shortened, this method may have potential as a non-invasive tool to investigate the physiological and pathological role of hemodynamics in human coronary arteries.},

   abstract = {Human right coronary artery (RCA) haemodynamics is investigated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on subject-specific information from magnetic resonance (MR) acquisitions. The dynamically varying vascular geometry is reconstructed from MR images, incorporated in CFD in conjunction with pulsatile flow conditions obtained from MR velocity mapping performed on the same subject. The effects of dynamic vessel motion on instantaneous and cycle-averaged haemodynamic parameters, such as wall shear stress (WSS), time-averaged WSS (TAWSS) and oscillatory shear index (OSI), are examined by comparing an RCA model with a time-varying geometry and those with a static geometry, corresponding to nine different time-points in the cardiac cycle. The results show that the TAWSS is similar for the dynamic and static wall models, both qualitatively and quantitatively (correlation coefficient 0.89-0.95). Conversely, the OSI shows much poorer correlations (correlation coefficient 0.38-0.60), with the best correspondence being observed with the static models constructed from images acquired in late diastole (at t = 0 and 800 ms, the cardiac cycle is 900 ms). These findings suggest that neglecting dynamic motion of the RCA is acceptable if TAWSS is the primary focus but may result in underestimation of haemodynamic parameters related to the oscillatory nature of the blood flow.},

   abstract = {The effects of changes in flow velocity waveform and arterial geometry before and after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the right coronary artery (RCA) were investigated using computational fluid dynamics. An RCA from a patient with a stenosis was reconstructed based on multislice computerized tomography images. A nonstenosed model, simulating the same RCA after PCI, was also constructed. The blood flows in the RCA models were simulated using pulsatile flow waveforms acquired with an intravascular ultrasound-Doppler probe in the RCA of a patient undergoing PCI. It was found that differences in the waveforms before and after PCI did not affect the time-averaged wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index, but the phase angle between pressure and wall shear stress on the endothelium, stress phase angle (SPA), differed markedly. The median SPA was -63.9 degrees (range, -204 degrees to -10.0 degrees ) for the pre-PCI state, whereas it was 10.4 degrees (range, -71.1 degrees to 25.4 degrees ) in the post-PCI state, i.e., more asynchronous in the pre-PCI state. SPA has been reported to influence the secretion of vasoactive molecules (e.g., nitric oxide, PGI(2), and endothelin-1), and asynchronous SPA ( approximately -180 degrees ) is proposed to be proatherogenic. Our results suggest that differences in the pulsatile flow waveform may have an important influence on atherogenesis, although associated with only minor changes in the time-averaged wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index. SPA may be a useful indicator in predicting sites prone to atherosclerosis.},

A 3-D model of a stenosed RCA was reconstructed based oil multislice computerized tomography images. A velocity waveform in the proximal RCA and a pressure waveform in the distal RCA of a patient with a severe stenosis were acquired with a catheter delivered wire probe and applied as boundary conditions. The arterial wall was modeled as a Mooncy-Rivlin hyperelastic material. The predicted maximum wall displacement (3.85 mm) was comparable with the vessel diameter (similar to 4 mm), but the diameter variation was much smaller, 0.134 mm at the stenosis and 0.486 mm in the distal region. Comparison of the computational results between the FSI and rigid-wall models showed that the instantaneous wall shear stress (WSS) distributions were affected by diameter variation in the arterial walk increasing systolic blood pressure dilated the vessel and consequently lowered WSS, whereas the opposite occurred When pressure started to decrease. However. file effects of wall compliance on time-averaged WSS (TAWSS) and oscillatory shear index (OSI) were insignificant (4.5 and 2.7% difference in maximum TAWSS and OSI. respectively).

A coronary artery was simulated with a 180 degrees curved tube 3mm in diameter and the effect of catheters of different diameters was modelled numerically under pulsatile flow conditions. The presence of a catheter increased pressure by 1.3-4.3 mmHg depending on its diameter, and reduced velocity-pressure phase-lag. For an ultrasound sample volume 5mm downstream from the probe tip, the underestimation in velocity measurement attributed to catheter blockage is approximately 15-21% for an average inlet velocity of 0.1m/s. The velocity measurement error is lower at higher mean flow velocity. Accuracy of clinical velocity measurements could be improved by moving the sample volume farther downstream from the probe tip, because the centrifugal pressure gradient intrinsic to the curvature promotes re-development of flow.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Remodelling of the cardiovascular system (including heart and vasculature) is a dynamic process influenced by multiple physiological and pathological factors. We sought to understand whether remodelling in response to a stimulus, exercise training, altered with healthy ageing. METHODS: A total of 237 untrained healthy male and female subjects volunteering for their first time marathon were recruited. At baseline and after 6 months of unsupervised training, race completers underwent tests including 1.5T cardiac magnetic resonance, brachial and non-invasive central blood pressure assessment. For analysis, runners were divided by age into under or over 35 years (U35, O35). RESULTS: Injury and completion rates were similar among the groups; 138 runners (U35: n = 71, women 49%; O35: n = 67, women 51%) completed the race. On average, U35 were faster by 37 minutes (12%). Training induced a small increase in left ventricular mass in both groups (3 g/m2, P < 0.001), but U35 also increased ventricular cavity sizes (left ventricular end-diastolic volume (EDV)i +3%; left ventricular end-systolic volume (ESV)i +8%; right ventricular end-diastolic volume (EDV)i +4%; right ventricular end-systolic volume (ESV)i +5%; P < 0.01 for all). Systemic aortic compliance fell in the whole sample by 7% (P = 0.020) and, especially in O35, also systemic vascular resistance (-4% in the whole sample, P = 0.04) and blood pressure (systolic/diastolic, whole sample: brachial -4/-3 mmHg, central -4/-2 mmHg, all P < 0.001; O35: brachial -6/-3 mmHg, central -6/-4 mmHg, all P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Medium-term, unsupervised physical training in healthy sedentary individuals induces measurable remodelling of both heart and vasculature. This amount is age dependent, with predominant cardiac remodelling when younger and predominantly vascular remodelling when older.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to explore sex differences in myocardial remodeling in aortic stenosis (AS) by using echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), and biomarkers. BACKGROUND: AS is a disease of both valve and left ventricle (LV). Sex differences in LV remodeling are reported in AS and may play a role in disease phenotyping. METHODS: This study was a prospective assessment of patients awaiting surgical valve replacement for severe AS using echocardiography, the 6-min walking test, biomarkers (high-sensitivity troponin T and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide), and CMR with late gadolinium enhancement and extracellular volume fraction, which dichotomizes the myocardium into matrix and cell volumes. LV remodeling was categorized into normal geometry, concentric remodeling, concentric hypertrophy, and eccentric hypertrophy. RESULTS: In 168 patients (age 70 +/- 10 years, 55% male, indexed aortic valve area 0.40 +/- 0.13 cm(2)/m(2), mean gradient 47 +/- 4 mm Hg), no sex or age differences in AS severity or functional capacity (6-min walking test) were found. CMR captured sex dimorphism in LV remodeling not apparent by using 2-dimensional echocardiography. Normal geometry (82% female) and concentric remodeling (60% female) dominated in women; concentric hypertrophy (71% male) and eccentric hypertrophy (76% male) dominated in men. Men also had more evidence of LV decompensation (pleural effusions), lower left ventricular ejection fraction (67 +/- 16% vs. 74 +/- 13%; p < 0.001), and higher levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (p = 0.04) and high-sensitivity troponin T (p = 0.01). Myocardial fibrosis was higher in men, with higher focal fibrosis (late gadolinium enhancement 16.5 +/- 11.2 g vs. 10.5 +/- 8.9 g; p < 0.001) and extracellular expansion (matrix volume 28.5 +/- 8.8 ml/m(2) vs. 21.4 +/- 6.3 ml/m(2); p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CMR revealed sex differences in associations between AS and myocardial remodeling not evident from echocardiography. Given equal valve severity, the myocardial response to AS seems more maladaptive in men than previously reported.

   abstract = {The parameters of wave intensity analysis are calculated from incremental changes in pressure and velocity. While it is clear that forward- and backward-traveling waves induce incremental changes in pressure, not all incremental changes in pressure are due to waves; changes in pressure may also be due to changes in the volume of a compliant structure. When the left ventricular ejects blood rapidly into the aorta, aortic pressure increases, in part, because of the increase in aortic volume: aortic inflow is momentarily greater than aortic outflow. Therefore, to properly quantify the effects of forward or backward waves on arterial pressure and velocity (flow), the component of the incremental change in arterial pressure that is due only to this increase in arterial volume--and not, fundamentally, due to waves--first must be excluded. This component is the pressure generated by the filling and emptying of the reservoir, Otto Frank's Windkessel.},

   abstract = {Interaction between arterial stiffness and hypertension plays an important role in the development of cardiovascular disease. Accordingly, assessment of arterial stiffness may provide a tool for estimating cardiovascular risk and monitoring therapy in hypertensive patients. Radiofrequency-based vascular ultrasound allows accurate noninvasive assessment of local mechanical properties of large arteries, but for its use in clinical practice, reference values according to age and sex are mandatory for each vascular site. To provide reference values for common carotid artery stiffness as assessed by an echo-tracking imaging system Hitachi-Aloka, we pooled measurements collected in 1847 healthy subjects aged 3-74 years (1008 males and 839 females) recruited in 14 European centers in the E-tracking International Collaboration (ETIC). Statistical models were developed to describe relationships of different stiffness indices with age and to calculate median values and Z-scores corresponding to +/- 1 and +/- 2 standard deviations. In our apparently healthy population, age accounted for 53% of variability in the elastic modulus (epsilon), 39% in arterial compliance, 47% in stiffness index (beta), and 56% in local pulse wave velocity; on average, blood pressure accounted for a further 7.5% of variability. Dependence on age was not linear; changes in mean values increased at older ages, especially for epsilon and beta. There was an interaction between age and gender for arterial compliance, which was higher in males. We present nomograms and a software that can be used for the automated calculation of Z-scores for local carotid stiffness in individual patients. These tools can be used to establish prognostic indicators or surrogate targets for treatment monitoring.},

Untransformed HVSMC were obtained from saphenous vein and in addition an SV-40 transformed immortalized cell line (HVTs-SM1) derived from saphenous vein smooth muscle was also used. HVTs-SM1 cell proliferation and DNA synthesis were measured, and cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry. Apoptosis in both cell types was assessed by a combination of flow cytometry, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TUNEL) reagent-based immunocytochemistry, DAPI staining, and DNA agarose gel electrophoresis. Lovastatin had no effect on apoptosis of HVSMC over 96 h in serum-free conditions or after stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB), although PDGF-BB increased apoptosis in HVSMC, and this was prevented by lovastatin. In HVTs-SM1 cells lovastatin inhibited cell proliferation and DNA synthesis and induced apoptosis in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The effects of lovastatin on cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, and apoptosis were prevented by coincubation with mevalonate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but not by farnesyl pyrophosphate. Lovastatin does not induce apoptosis in saphenous vein HVSMC in culture and inhibits PDGF-BB-induced DNA synthesis and apoptosis. In contrast, in SV40 transformed immortalized HVTs-SM1 cells, lovastatin induces apoptosis and inhibits cell proliferation and DNA synthesis. The pro-apoptotic effects of lovastatin in SV40 transformed HVTs-SM1 cells may be related to the enhanced rate of proliferation or deregulation of the cell cycle in this cell line.},

PA induced a time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation over 3 days and 48 h exposure to PA inhibited [methyl-3H-thymidine incorporation induced by 10% fetal calf serum in a concentration-dependent manner.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) experience a reduction in right ventricular long axis velocities post surgery. OBJECTIVES: We tested whether the phenomenon of right ventricular (RV) long axis velocity decline depends on the chest being opened fully by mid-line sternotomy, pericardial incision, or on the type of operation performed. METHOD: By intraoperative transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) we recorded serial right ventricular (RV) systolic pulse-wave tissue Doppler velocities during 6 types of elective procedure: 53 CABG surgery, 15 robotic-assisted minimally-invasive CABG (RCABG), 28 aortic valve replacement (AVR), 8 minimally-invasive aortic valve replacement (mini-AVR), 5 mediastinal mass excision, and 1 left atrial myxoma excision. Pre and post operative transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) were also conducted. RESULTS: Surgery without substantial opening of the pericardium did not significantly reduce RV systolic velocities (RCABG 13 +/- 1.8 versus 12.4 +/- 2.7 cm/s post; mini-AVR 11.9 +/- 2.3 versus 11.1 +/- 2.3 cm/s; mediastinal mass excision 13.9 +/- 3.1 versus 13.8 +/- 4 cm/s). In contrast, within 5 min of pericardial incision those whose surgery involved full opening of the pericardium had large reductions in RV velocities: 54 +/- 11% decline with CABG (11.3 +/- 1.9 to 5.1 +/- 1.6 cm/s, p<0.0001), 54 +/- 5% with AVR (12.6 +/- 1.4 to 5.7 +/- 0.6 cm/s, p<0.001) and 49% with left atrial myxoma excision (11.3 to 15.8 cm/s). This persisted immediately after pericardial opening to the end of surgery (61 +/- 11%, p<0.0001; 58 +/- 7%, p<0.0001; 59% respectively). CONCLUSIONS: It is full opening of the pericardium, and not cardiac surgery in general, which causes RV long axis decline following cardiac surgery. The impact is immediate (within 5 min) and persistent.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Microvascular rarefaction, the functional reduction in perfused microvessels and structural reduction of microvascular density, seems to be an important mechanism in the pathophysiology of small blood vessel-related disorders including vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) due to cerebral small vessel disease and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Both diseases share common risk factors including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and ageing; in turn, these comorbidities are associated with microvascular rarefaction. Our consortium aims to investigate novel non-invasive tools to quantify microvascular health and rarefaction in both organs, as well as surrogate biomarkers for cerebral and/or cardiac rarefaction (via sublingual capillary health, vascular density of the retina, and RNA content of circulating extracellular vesicles), and to determine whether microvascular density relates to disease severity. METHODS: The clinical research program of CRUCIAL consists of four observational cohort studies. We aim to recruit 75 VCI patients, 60 HFpEF patients, 60 patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement as a pressure overload HFpEF model, and 200 elderly participants with mixed comorbidities to serve as controls. Data collected will include medical history, physical examination, cognitive testing, advanced brain and cardiac MRI, ECG, echocardiography, sublingual capillary health, optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTa), extracellular vesicles RNA analysis, and myocardial remodelling-related serum biomarkers. The AS cohort undergoing surgery will also have myocardial biopsy for histological microvascular assessment. DISCUSSION: CRUCIAL will examine the pathophysiological role of microvascular rarefaction in VCI and HFpEF using advanced brain and cardiac MRI techniques. Furthermore, we will investigate surrogate biomarkers for non-invasive, faster, easier, and cheaper assessment of microvascular density since these are more likely to be disseminated into widespread clinical practice. If microvascular rarefaction is an early marker of developing small vessel diseases, then measuring rarefaction may allow preclinical diagnosis, with implications for screening, risk stratification, and prevention. Further knowledge of the relevance of microvascular rarefaction and its underlying mechanisms may provide new avenues for research and therapeutic targets.},

This study aimed to determine the relationship between blood pressure variability indices and retinal arteriolar diameter in non-diabetic and type II diabetes participants. Digitized retinal images were analysed to quantify arteriolar diameters in 35 non-diabetic (aged 52 +/- 11 years; 49% male) and 28 type II diabetes (aged 61 +/- 9 years; 50% male) participants. Blood pressure variability was derived from 24-h ambulatory blood pressure. Arteriolar diameter was positively associated with daytime rate of systolic blood pressure variation (p = 0.04) among type II diabetes participants and negatively among non-diabetics (p = 0.008; interaction p = 0.001). This finding was maintained after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index and mean daytime systolic blood pressure. These findings suggest that the blood pressure variability-related mechanisms underlying retinal vascular disease may differ between people with and without type II diabetes.},

After acquisition with a multislice spiral CT, the thoracic images are processed to reconstruct the geometry of the trachea and the first six bronchus generations and to virtually travel inside this duct network. The facetisation associated with the 3D reconstruction of the tracheobronchial tree is improved to get a computation-adapted surface triangulation, which leads to a volumic mesh composed of tetrahedra. The Navier-Stokes equations associated with the classical boundary conditions and different values of the flow dimensionless parameters are solved using the finite element method. The airways are supposed to be rigid during rest breathing. The flow distribution among the set of bronchi is determined during the respiratory cycle. Cycle reproducibility and mesh size effects on the numerical results are examined. Helpful qualitative data are provided rather than accurate quantitative results in the context of multimodelling, from image processing to numerical simulations.},

   abstract = {Pinacidil is thought to cause vasodilatation by opening K+ channels and consequent hyperpolarization. This proposed mechanism of action is based mainly on membrane potential measurements and 42K or 86Rb efflux experiments under resting conditions. We have measured the simultaneous effect of pinacidil on force and membrane potential in resting and norepinephrine-contracted rat mesenteric resistance vessels. Also the effect of pinacidil on 42K and 36Cl efflux and 22Na uptake in the absence and presence of norepinephrine was examined. From the membrane potential and ion flux measurements the ion permeabilities were calculated. In both resting and norepinephrine-contracted vessels, pinacidil caused a large hyperpolarization, the latter situation being associated with an almost complete relaxation. In both resting and norepinephrine-stimulated vessels, pinacidil caused a large increase in K+ permeability and a decrease in Cl-permeability, whereas no significant change of Na+ permeability was found. Our results suggest that pinacidil causes vasodilation due to hyperpolarization. The major cause for the hyperpolarization is an increase in K+ permeability.},

   abstract = {STUDY AIM: Retinal microvasculature changes reflect systemic small vessel damage from obesity. The impact of bariatric surgery induced weight loss on the microvasculature is relatively unknown. We hypothesized that weight loss following bariatric surgery would be associated with improved structural changes in the retinal microvasculature, reflecting an overall improvement in microvascular health. METHODS: The study included 22 obese subjects scheduled for bariatric surgery (laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or a sleeve gastrectomy) and 15 lean, age-matched controls. Ophthalmic examination, including fundus photography, was performed at baseline and 6-months. Retinal microvasculature caliber was analysed quantitatively using a semi-automated computer program and summarized as central retinal artery equivalent (CRAE) and venular equivalent (CRVE). RESULTS: Mean weight loss at 6 months was 26.1 kg +/- 8 kg in the bariatric surgery group. Retinal artery caliber increased (136.0 +/- 1.4 to 141.4 +/- 1.4 microm, p = 0.013) and venular caliber decreased (202.9 +/- 1.9 to 197.3 +/- 1.9 microm, p = 0.046) in the bariatric surgery group by 6 months, with no change in arteriolar (136.6 +/- 1.1 to 134.5 +/- 1.2, p = 0.222) or venular (195.1 +/- 2.1 to 193.3 +/- 2.2, p = 0.550) caliber in the control group. The arteriolar to venular ratio increased in the bariatric surgery group, with no change in the control group at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest obesity-related microvascular changes are reversible after bariatric surgery-induced weight loss. The capacity for the retinal microvasculature to improve following bariatric surgery suggests plasticity of the human microvasculature early in the disease course.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Ethnic differences in cardiovascular disease incidence, but not cardiovascular disease recurrence, are reported. We characterised long-term risk of major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) and mortality following a non-fatal cardiovascular event in a British cohort of South Asians, African Caribbeans and Europeans. METHODS: We identified index and recurrent cardiovascular events and mortality between 1988 and 2017 using hospital records and death registry. Using multivariable hazards models, we separately calculated the adjusted HR of MACE and death following index event, adjusting for demographics, vascular and lifestyle risk factors. Using interaction terms, we evaluated if decade of index event modified the association between ethnicity and outcomes. RESULTS: South Asians were younger at the index event (median age 66 years, n=396) than Europeans (69 years, n=335) and African Caribbeans (70 years, n=70). During 4228 person-years, of the 801 patients, 537 developed MACE and 338 died, with the highest crude rate of MACE in South Asians. On adjustment of baseline factors, compared with the Europeans, the higher risk of MACE (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.21) and the lower risk of mortality (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.26) in South Asians was eliminated. African Caribbeans had similar outcomes to Europeans (HR MACE 1.04, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.47; and HR death 1.07, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.64). Long-term survival following an index event improved in South Asians (ptrend 0.02) and African Caribbeans (ptrend 0.07) compared with Europeans. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline vascular risk factors explained the observed ethnic variation in cardiovascular disease recurrence and long-term mortality, with a relative improvement in survival of minority ethnic groups over time.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of family history in determining excess risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in South Asians compared with Europeans is unclear. We hypothesized that family history would be more strongly associated with CHD in South Asians. METHODS: We performed cross-sectional analyses of 20-year follow-up data from SABRE (Southall And Brent Revisited) population-based study. Initial recruitment (1988-1991) was by random selection from general practitioners' lists in north-west London. 974 Europeans and 734 South Asians completed follow-up questionnaire (2008-2011) and had complete CHD and family history data. 831 participants without cardiovascular disease had complete coronary artery calcium (CAC) data. RESULTS: South Asians with family history of CHD were more likely to have diagnosed CHD (odds ratio 1.71 [95% CI 1.21, 2.42]; p=0.002) and more previous CHD events (regression coefficient 0.44 [0.16, 0.72]; p=0.002) than those without family history, independent of biological and sociodemographic risk factors. Family history associations with diagnosed CHD/number of events were weaker in Europeans (odds ratio 1.11 [0.78, 1.57]; p=0.562/regression coefficient 0.02 [-0.25, 0.30]; p=0.878), largely explained by biological risk factors. South Asians with family history had modestly increased CAC burden compared with Europeans. CONCLUSIONS: There were markedly stronger associations between family history and clinical CHD in South Asians, and a similar trend for subclinical CHD. Early preventive and therapeutic interventions are particularly important in South Asians with a family history of CHD.},

We investigated associations between a comprehensive set of measures of macro and microvascular disease and depressive symptoms in older men and women. METHODS: We performed cross-sectional analyses of the SABRE (Southall And Brent REvisited) population-based study. Participants (1396) attended clinic between 2008 and 2011 for assessment of subclinical macrovascular (carotid ultrasound, echocardiography, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging) and microvascular (retinopathy, nephropathy) disease, and depression. RESULTS: Mean age of 1396 participants was 69.5 years, and 76.2% were male. The median (interquartile range) of depression score was 1 [0, 2] for men and 1 [0, 3] for women. All measures of subclinical macro and microvascular disease were adversely associated with depressive symptoms, even when known CVD was excluded. Physical activity partly explained some of these relationships. The association between left atrial dimension index (LADI), a measure of chronic elevated left ventricular filling pressure, and depressive symptoms was stronger in women (regression coefficient 0.23 [95% CI 0.11, 0.35]) than men (0.07 [-0.01, 0.15]), p for interaction 0.06, on multivariable adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical macro and microvascular disease is associated with depressive symptoms, even in the absence of established CVD. These were in part accounted for by physical activity. We observed stronger association between LADI and depressive symptoms in women than in men. The beneficial role of physical activity in abrogating the association between subclinical CVD and depression warrants further investigation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Our objective was to demonstrate wave propagation and reflection in the canine aorta. Recently we proposed that aortic pressure is the instantaneous sum of wave-related or "excess" pressure and reservoir or windkessel pressure. Accordingly, in this research we calculated reservoir pressure and subtracted it from measured pressure to identify the change in pressure due to forward- or backward-travelling waves. METHODS: In 8 anesthetized dogs, excess pressures were calculated from pressure and flow measurements at 4 locations along the aorta; wave intensity analysis was employed to identify wavefronts and the type of waves. RESULTS: We found that forward compression and decompression waves generated by the left ventricle are reflected, first, from a negative or "open-end" reflection site near the renal arteries (32.0 +/- 0.8 cm [SEM] from the aortic root) and, second, from a positive site in the femoral arteries (65.3 +/- 2.8 cm or 54.9 +/- 2.1 cm, based on 2 alternative extrapolation techniques). CONCLUSIONS: Aortic wave propagation and reflection can be demonstrated clearly and directly by wave intensity analysis after volume-related changes-changes in reservoir or windkessel pressure-in aortic pressure are accounted for.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The life course accumulation of overt and subclinical myocardial dysfunction contributes to older age mortality, frailty, disability and loss of independence. The Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) is the world's longest running continued surveillance birth cohort providing a unique opportunity to understand life course determinants of myocardial dysfunction as part of MyoFit46-the cardiac sub-study of the NSHD. METHODS: We aim to recruit 550 NSHD participants of approximately 75 years+ to undertake high-density surface electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) and stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). Through comprehensive myocardial tissue characterization and 4-dimensional flow we hope to better understand the burden of clinical and subclinical cardiovascular disease. Supercomputers will be used to combine the multi-scale ECGI and CMR datasets per participant. Rarely available, prospectively collected whole-of-life data on exposures, traditional risk factors and multimorbidity will be studied to identify risk trajectories, critical change periods, mediators and cumulative impacts on the myocardium. DISCUSSION: By combining well curated, prospectively acquired longitudinal data of the NSHD with novel CMR-ECGI data and sharing these results and associated pipelines with the CMR community, MyoFit46 seeks to transform our understanding of how early, mid and later-life risk factor trajectories interact to determine the state of cardiovascular health in older age.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) generates electrophysiological (EP) biomarkers while cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging provides data about myocardial structure, function and tissue substrate. Combining this information in one examination is desirable but requires an affordable, reusable, and high-throughput solution. We therefore developed the CMR-ECGI vest and carried out this technical development study to assess its feasibility and repeatability in vivo. METHODS: CMR was prospectively performed at 3T on participants after collecting surface potentials using the locally designed and fabricated 256-lead ECGI vest. Epicardial maps were reconstructed to generate local EP parameters such as activation time (AT), repolarization time (RT) and activation recovery intervals (ARI). 20 intra- and inter-observer and 8 scan re-scan repeatability tests. RESULTS: 77 participants were recruited: 27 young healthy volunteers (HV, 38.9 +/- 8.5 years, 35% male) and 50 older persons (77.0 +/- 0.1 years, 52% male). CMR-ECGI was achieved in all participants using the same reusable, washable vest without complications. Intra- and inter-observer variability was low (correlation coefficients [r(s)] across unipolar electrograms = 0.99 and 0.98 respectively) and scan re-scan repeatability was high (r(s) between 0.81 and 0.93). Compared to young HV, older persons had significantly longer RT (296.8 vs 289.3 ms, p = 0.002), ARI (249.8 vs 235.1 ms, p = 0.002) and local gradients of AT, RT and ARI (0.40 vs 0.34 ms/mm, p = 0,01; 0.92 vs 0.77 ms/mm, p = 0.03; and 1.12 vs 0.92 ms/mm, p = 0.01 respectively). CONCLUSION: Our high-throughput CMR-ECGI solution is feasible and shows good reproducibility in younger and older participants. This new technology is now scalable for high throughput research to provide novel insights into arrhythmogenesis and potentially pave the way for more personalised risk stratification.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Home working has increased since the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic's onset with concerns that it may have adverse health implications. We assessed the association between home working and social and mental wellbeing among the employed population aged 16 to 66 through harmonised analyses of 7 UK longitudinal studies. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We estimated associations between home working and measures of psychological distress, low life satisfaction, poor self-rated health, low social contact, and loneliness across 3 different stages of the pandemic (T1 = April to June 2020 -first lockdown, T2 = July to October 2020 -eased restrictions, T3 = November 2020 to March 2021 -second lockdown) using modified Poisson regression and meta-analyses to pool results across studies. We successively adjusted the model for sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex), job characteristics (e.g., sector of activity, pre-pandemic home working propensities), and pre-pandemic health. Among respectively 10,367, 11,585, and 12,179 participants at T1, T2, and T3, we found higher rates of home working at T1 and T3 compared with T2, reflecting lockdown periods. Home working was not associated with psychological distress at T1 (RR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.79 to 1.08) or T2 (RR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.88 to 1.11), but a detrimental association was found with psychological distress at T3 (RR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.30). Study limitations include the fact that pre-pandemic home working propensities were derived from external sources, no information was collected on home working dosage and possible reverse association between change in wellbeing and home working likelihood. CONCLUSIONS: No clear evidence of an association between home working and mental wellbeing was found, apart from greater risk of psychological distress during the second lockdown, but differences across subgroups (e.g., by sex or level of education) may exist. Longer term shifts to home working might not have adverse impacts on population wellbeing in the absence of pandemic restrictions but further monitoring of health inequalities is required.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Atrioventricular (AV) optimization of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is typically calculated at rest. However, patients often become symptomatic during exercise. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we use acute noninvasive hemodynamics to optimize the AV delay of CRT during exercise and investigate whether this exercise optimum can be predicted from a three-phase resting model. METHODS: In 20 patients with CRT, we adjusted the sensed AV delay while the patient exercised on a treadmill up to a heart rate of 100 bpm to identify the hemodynamically optimal value. Separately, at rest, by pacing with three different configurations and calculating the sensed-paced difference, we calculated an "expected" value for the exercise optimum. RESULTS: It was possible to perform AV delay optimization while a patient exercised. The resting three-phase model correlated well with the actual exercise optimal AV delay (r = 0.85, mean difference +/- standard deviation [SD] = 3.7 +/- 17 ms). Simply using measurements made at rest during atrial-sensed pacing showed a poorer correlation with exercise (r = 0.64, mean difference +/- SD = 2.2 +/- 24 ms). The three-phase resting model allows improved exercise hemodynamics to be achieved. Programming according to the three-phase resting model yields an exercise blood pressure of only 0.5 mmHg (+/-1.4 mmHg; P = NS) less than the true exercise optimum, whereas programming the resting sensed optimum yields an exercise blood pressure of 1.4 mmHg (+/-2.2 mmHg, P = .02) less than the true optimum. CONCLUSIONS: Using acute noninvasive hemodynamics and a protocol of alternations, it is possible to optimize the AV delay of cardiac resynchronization devices even while a patient exercises. In clinical practice, the exercise optimum AV delay could be determined from three phases of resting measurements, without performing exercise.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several hemodynamic measures have been used for optimization of the AV delay of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), including pulse pressure (PP), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and cardiac output (CO). We aimed to determine whether these measures identify the same optimum and whether they have the same efficiency and reproducibility at identifying this optimum. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 22 patients with cardiac resynchronization therapy, we adjusted the AV delay while atrially pacing at 110 bpm and simultaneously recording SBP, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), PP, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and CO. SBP, PP and CO all had essentially the same signal-to-noise ratios (15.4+/-5.4, 15.5+/-6.4, 15.3+/-7.4 respectively p=NS). In contrast, MAP and DBP had significantly worse signal-to-noise ratios than SBP (14.2+/-5.6, p=0.003 and 12.1+/-4.4, p<0.0001 respectively). The optimal AV delay was very similar between SBP, PP, MAP and DBP. For example, the optima identified by SBP correlated strongly with those identified by PP (r=0.94), MAP (r=0.96) and DBP (r=0.90). In contrast, the optima detected by CO was poorly related to these (e.g. r=0.36 with SBP optima). Reproducibility was best for optima detected by SBP followed by MAP and PP. CONCLUSIONS: Essentially the same AV optimum is identified, regardless of whether the parameter chosen for maximization is SBP, PP, MAP or DBP. We conclude that optimizing the CRT AV delay using SBP gives the best combination of efficiency and reproducibility, with PP and MAP being reasonable alternatives.},

   abstract = {AIMS: In this study, we apply non-invasive blood pressure (BP) monitoring, by continuous finger photoplethysmography (Finometer), to detect directly haemodynamic responses during adjustment of the atrioventricular (AV) delay of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), at different heart rates. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twelve patients were studied with six re-attending for reproducibility assessment. At each AV delay, systolic BP relative to a reference AV delay of 120 ms (SBPrel) was calculated. We found that at higher heart rates, altering the AV delay had a more pronounced effect on BP (average range of SBPrel=17.4 mmHg) compared with resting rates (average range of SBPrel=6.5 mmHg), P<0.0001. Secondly, peak AV delay differed between patients (minimum 120 ms, maximum 200 ms). Thirdly, small changes in AV delay had significant BP effects: programming AV delay 40 ms below the peak AV delay reduced SBPrel by 4.9 mmHg (P<0.003); having it 40 ms above the peak decreased SBPrel by 4.4 mmHg (P<0.0005). Finally, the peak AV delay is highly reproducible both on the same day and at 3 months (Bland-Altman difference: 3+/-8 ms). CONCLUSIONS: Continuous non-invasive arterial pressure monitoring demonstrates that even small changes in AV delay from its haemodynamic peak value have a significant effect on BP. This peak varies between individuals, is highly reproducible, and is more pronounced at higher heart rates than resting rates.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the haemodynamic effect of simultaneously adjusting atrioventricular (AV) and interventricular (VV) delays. METHOD: 35 different combinations of AV and VV delay were tested by using digital photoplethysmography (Finometer) with repeated alternations to measure relative change in systolic blood pressure (SBP(rel)) in 15 patients with cardiac resynchronisation devices for heart failure. RESULTS: Changing AV delay had a larger effect than changing VV delay (range of SBP(rel) 21 v 4.2 mm Hg, p < 0.001). Each had a curvilinear effect. The curve of response to AV delay fitted extremely closely to a parabola (average R2 = 0.99, average residual variance 0.8 mm Hg2). The response to VV delay was significantly less curved (quadratic coefficient 67 v 1194 mm Hg/s2, p = 0.003) and therefore, although the residual variance was equally small (0.8 mm Hg2), the R2 value was 0.7. Reproducibility at two months was good, with the SD of the difference between two measurements of SBP(rel) being 2.5 mm Hg for AV delay (2% of mean systolic blood pressure) and 1.5 mm Hg for VV delay (1% of mean systolic blood pressure). CONCLUSIONS: Changing AV and VV delays results in a curvilinear acute blood pressure response. This shape fits very closely to a parabola, which may be valuable information in developing a streamlined clinical protocol. VV delay adjustment provides an additional, albeit smaller, haemodynamic benefit to AV optimisation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: During optimization of the atrioventricular (AV) delay of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), it is not known exactly which windows of time around the transition are most informative for identification of the optimum. METHOD AND RESULTS: IN 22 patients with CRT, we performed AV delay optimization using continuous noninvasive hemodynamics. We used signal-to-noise ratio to determine the most efficient averaging window location and width. We found that it is most efficient to position the averaging windows immediately before and immediately after the transition in AV delay. For example, skipping five beats after the transition decreases signal-to-noise ratio by 17.5% (P < 0.0001). Similarly, skipping five beats immediately before the transition reduces signal-to-noise ratio by 11.7% (P < 0.0001). The best choice of "fixed" averaging window width was found to be six beats, with signal-to-noise ratio falling by, for example, 41% for a one-beat window (P = 0.0002). However, even better was to set the window width for each patient to match one respiratory cycle. We observed that the pre- and posttransition signal-to-noise ratio traces begin to diverge three beats after the transition in AV delay. We believe this represents the time taken for the peripheral response to pacing-induced changes in stroke volume to occur. CONCLUSIONS: THE most efficient way to use alternating transitions for the hemodynamic optimization of CRT is to use an averaging window of one respiratory cycle, and not to skip any beats between the pretransition and posttransition averaging windows.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Echocardiographic optimization of pacemaker settings is the current standard of care for patients treated with cardiac resynchronization therapy. However, the process requires considerable time of expert staff. The BRAVO study is a non-inferiority trial comparing echocardiographic optimization of atrioventricular (AV) and interventricular (VV) delay with an alternative method using non-invasive blood pressure monitoring that can be automated to consume less staff resources. METHODS/DESIGN: BRAVO is a multi-centre, randomized, cross-over, non-inferiority trial of 400 patients with a previously implanted cardiac resynchronization device. Patients are randomly allocated to six months in each arm. In the echocardiographic arm, AV delay is optimized using the iterative method and VV delay by maximizing LVOT VTI. In the haemodynamic arm AV and VV delay are optimized using non-invasive blood pressure measured using finger photoplethysmography. At the end of each six month arm, patients undergo the primary outcome measure of objective exercise capacity, quantified as peak oxygen uptake (VO2) on a cardiopulmonary exercise test. Secondary outcome measures are echocardiographic measurement of left ventricular remodelling, quality of life score and N-terminal pro B-type Natriuretic Peptide (NT-pro BNP). The study is scheduled to complete recruitment in December 2013 and to complete follow up in December 2014. DISCUSSION: If exercise capacity is non-inferior with haemodynamic optimization compared with echocardiographic optimization, it would be proof of concept that haemodynamic optimization is an acceptable alternative which has the potential to be more easily implemented.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: BRAVO (British Randomized Controlled Trial of AV and VV Optimization) is a multicenter, randomized, crossover, noninferiority trial comparing echocardiographic optimization of atrioventricular (AV) and interventricular delay with a noninvasive blood pressure method. BACKGROUND: Cardiac resynchronization therapy including AV delay optimization confers clinical benefit, but the optimization requires time and expertise to perform. METHODS: This study randomized patients to echocardiographic optimization or hemodynamic optimization using multiple-replicate beat-by-beat noninvasive blood pressure at baseline; after 6 months, participants were crossed over to the other optimization arm of the trial. The primary outcome was exercise capacity, quantified as peak exercise oxygen uptake. Secondary outcome measures were echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) remodeling, quality-of-life scores, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide. RESULTS: A total of 401 patients were enrolled, the median age was 69 years, 78% of patients were men, and the New York Heart Association functional class was II in 84% and III in 16%. The primary endpoint, peak oxygen uptake, met the criterion for noninferiority (pnoninferiority = 0.0001), with no significant difference between the hemodynamically optimized arm and echocardiographically optimized arm of the trial (mean difference 0.1 ml/kg/min). Secondary endpoints for noninferiority were also met for symptoms (mean difference in Minnesota score 1; pnoninferiority = 0.002) and hormonal changes (mean change in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide -10 pg/ml; pnoninferiority = 0.002). There was no significant difference in LV size (mean change in LV systolic dimension 1 mm; pnoninferiority < 0.001; LV diastolic dimension 0 mm; pnoninferiority <0.001). In 30% of patients the AV delay identified as optimal was more than 20 ms from the nominal setting of 120 ms. CONCLUSIONS: Optimization of cardiac resynchronization therapy devices by using noninvasive blood pressure is noninferior to echocardiographic optimization. Therefore, noninvasive hemodynamic optimization is an acceptable alternative that has the potential to be automated and thus more easily implemented.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In March 2020, the UK implemented the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (furlough) to minimise job losses. Our aim was to investigate associations between furlough and diet, physical activity, and sleep during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analysed data on 25,092 participants aged 16-66 years from eight UK longitudinal studies. Changes in employment, including being furloughed, were based on employment status before and during the first lockdown. Health behaviours included fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity, and sleep. Study-specific estimates obtained using modified Poisson regression, adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics and pre-pandemic health and health behaviours, were statistically pooled using random effects meta-analysis. Associations were also stratified by sex, age, and education. RESULTS: Across studies, between 8 and 25% of participants were furloughed. Compared to those who remained working, furloughed workers were slightly less likely to be physically inactive (RR = 0.85; [95% CI 0.75-0.97]; I (2) = 59%) and did not differ overall with respect to low fruit and vegetable consumption or atypical sleep, although findings for sleep were heterogenous (I (2) = 85%). In stratified analyses, furlough was associated with lower fruit and vegetable consumption among males (RR = 1.11; [1.01-1.22]; I (2) = 0%) but not females (RR = 0.84; [0.68-1.04]; I (2) = 65%). Considering changes in quantity, furloughed workers were more likely than those who remained working to report increases in fruit and vegetable consumption, exercise, and hours of sleep. CONCLUSIONS: Those furloughed exhibited similar health behaviours to those who remained in employment during the initial stages of the pandemic. There was little evidence to suggest that adoption of such social protection policies in the post-pandemic recovery period and during future economic crises had adverse effects on population health behaviours.},

   abstract = {Selective inhibitors of tyrosine kinases, tyrphostin 23 and genistein, produced concentration-dependent inhibition of voltage-operated calcium channel currents in vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from rabbit ear artery. The potency of these two structurally dissimilar inhibitors was similar to that reported for their action as inhibitors of tyrosine kinases. Daidzein, an inactive analogue of genistein, had little inhibitory effect on calcium channel currents at concentrations below 300 microM consistent with an action of these agents at a tyrosine kinase. However, tyrphostin 1, a reportedly less active tyrphostin derivative, also inhibited calcium channel currents with a potency similar to tyrphostin 23. These findings suggest that voltage-operated calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle may be modulated by endogenous tyrosine kinase(s) which display different sensitivities to inhibitors compared with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. Alternatively the possibility of direct blocking actions of these inhibitors at voltage-operated calcium channels cannot be excluded.},

   abstract = {Voltage-operated calcium channels are modulated by tyrosine kinases in different cell types. In this study, I(Ba) was measured by the whole cell voltage-clamp technique in single COS-7 cells overexpressing the Ca(v)2.2 calcium channels encoding N-type currents. Bath application of genistein, a nonselective PTK inhibitor (50-300 microM), concentration-dependently inhibited calcium channel currents, whereas the inactive structural analogue, daidzein, was without effect over the same concentration range. Similarly, PP1, a src family-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, inhibited I(Ba) in a concentration-dependent manner (500 nM-5 microM) over a range of test potentials. Expression of the Ca(v)2.2alpha1 (alpha(1B)) subunit alone gave rise to functional channels, and genistein (100 microM) also inhibited currents elicited by the alpha(1B) subunit alone. These results indicate that tyrosine kinase inhibitors are likely to inhibit Ca(v)2.2 calcium channels via an action on the pore-forming alpha(1) subunit and suggest that an endogenous member of the Src family may play a physiological role in modulating these channels.},

   abstract = {Contraction induced by hyposmotic swelling was examined in rat tail arteries mounted on a myograph containing a modified Krebs physiological saline solution (PSS) containing 50 mM mannitol (300 mosm/l). Hyposmotic swelling was induced by removing mannitol. In arteries having basal tone or arteries precontracted with K(+) or the thromboxane mimetic U-46619, removal of mannitol caused a concentration dependent contraction of rat tail arteries. Concurrent measurement of tension and intracellular calcium [Ca(2+)](i )in arteries loaded with fura-2 showed that both tension and [Ca(2+)](i) increased on exposure to a hyposmotic solution. Removal of endothelium or inhibition of nitric oxide and cyclooxygenase together did not affect contractile responses. Removal of extracellular Ca(2+) abolished the contractile response to hyposmotic solution and NiCl(2), a nonspecific inhibitor of Ca(2+) influx pathways, blocked the rise in [Ca(2+)](i) and tension in response to a hyposmotic solution. Verapamil and nisoldipine, inhibitors of Ca(v)1.2 (L-type) calcium channels significantly reduced the contractile response to a hyposmotic solution. Addition of NiCl(2) to nisoldipine caused an additional inhibition of the response to a hyposmotic solution. Inhibition of calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum by ryanodine or cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) did not cause any change in the tension response to a hyposmotic solution. CPA did not significantly inhibit the response to a hyposmotic solution in the presence of N(G)-methyl-L-arginine, oxyhaemoglobin and indomethacin. We conclude that contraction induced by a hyposmotic solution is largely due to Ca(v)1.2 calcium channels although other Ca(2+) influx pathways also contribute.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Hypotonic solutions cause vasoconstriction in rat tail arteries, due largely to activation of L-type calcium channels (CaV1.2). We studied possible roles of tyrosine kinases, particularly src family kinases (SFK) and extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK1/2), in this response. METHODS: Rat tail arteries were mounted on a myograph for measurement of isometric force. Arteries were bathed in isosmotic physiological saline solution (300 mOsm/l) containing 50 mmol/l mannitol and were stimulated by a hyposmotic solution containing 0 mmol/l mannitol (PSS-M). Activation of tyrosine kinases and ERK1/2 by hyposmotic solution was examined by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting on rat tail artery lysates with specific phospho-antibodies. RESULTS: Western blotting showed SFK src and yes present in rat tail artery. PSS-M increased tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, including SFK and ERK1/2. Genistein blocked phosphorylation of SFK and ERK1/2 by PSS-M. In isolated arteries PSS-M caused a contraction inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, and three structurally different selective SFK inhibitors, herbimycin-A, PP1 and SU6656. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 or selective inhibitors of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (AG1296) and epidermal growth factor receptor (AG1478) had no effect on contraction induced by a hypotonic solution. CONCLUSIONS: Hyposmotic conditions activate SFK, src and yes, and contract rat tail artery by a SFK-dependent mechanism. ERK1/2 are activated by the hypotonic solution, but do not play a role in the contractile response. SFK modulation of CaV1.2 may be an important mechanism mediating vasoconstriction to mechanical stimuli in vascular smooth muscle.},

   abstract = {1. Tyrosine kinases have been proposed as regulators of voltage-operated calcium channels. The effects of a range of structurally different inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) were examined on voltage-operated calcium channel currents (I(Ba)) and pp60(c-src) kinase (c-src) activity in vitro. 2. I(Ba) was measured in single myocytes isolated from rabbit ear artery by conventional whole cell voltage-clamp techniques. The activity of purified human c-src was measured in vitro using a non-radioactive assay. 3. Bath application of tyrphostin-23 and genistein (non-selective PTK inhibitors), bistyrphostin (a receptor-PTK-selective inhibitor) and PP1 (a src family-selective inhibitor) inhibited I(Ba) in a concentration-dependent manner over a range of test membrane potentials. Intracellular application of peptide-A, a peptide inhibitor of c-src also inhibited currents. Inhibitor potency series against I(Ba) was PP1 > genistein > tyrphostin 23 > bistyrphostin. 4. Tyrphostin-23, genistein, PP1, and peptide-A shifted the steady-state inactivation curves in a hyperpolarized direction without altering their slope. The inhibitors had no significant effects on I(Ba) activation calculated from current-voltage relationships. 5. The agents inhibited c-src activity in a concentration-dependent manner. The order of potency was PP1 > genistein > peptide-A > tyrphostin-23 > bistyrphostin. The IC(50) for inhibition of c-src activity was similar to the IC(50) for inhibition of I(Ba) in all cases. 6. Western blot analysis with a specific antibody to c-src showed the presence of this cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase in rabbit ear artery cells. 7. A range of structurally dissimilar inhibitors of PTKs inhibit I(Ba) and c-src activity with similar potency. These data provide further evidence implicating endogenous c-src in the modulation of L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle cells.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding the genetic architecture of cardiac structure and function may help to prevent and treat heart disease. This investigation sought to identify common genetic variations associated with inter-individual variability in cardiac structure and function. METHODS: A GWAS meta-analysis of echocardiographic traits was performed, including 46,533 individuals from 30 studies (EchoGen consortium). The analysis included 16 traits of left ventricular (LV) structure, and systolic and diastolic function. RESULTS: The discovery analysis included 21 cohorts for structural and systolic function traits (n = 32,212) and 17 cohorts for diastolic function traits (n = 21,852). Replication was performed in 5 cohorts (n = 14,321) and 6 cohorts (n = 16,308), respectively. Besides 5 previously reported loci, the combined meta-analysis identified 10 additional genome-wide significant SNPs: rs12541595 near MTSS1 and rs10774625 in ATXN2 for LV end-diastolic internal dimension; rs806322 near KCNRG, rs4765663 in CACNA1C, rs6702619 near PALMD, rs7127129 in TMEM16A, rs11207426 near FGGY, rs17608766 in GOSR2, and rs17696696 in CFDP1 for aortic root diameter; and rs12440869 in IQCH for Doppler transmitral A-wave peak velocity. Findings were in part validated in other cohorts and in GWAS of related disease traits. The genetic loci showed associations with putative signaling pathways, and with gene expression in whole blood, monocytes, and myocardial tissue. CONCLUSION: The additional genetic loci identified in this large meta-analysis of cardiac structure and function provide insights into the underlying genetic architecture of cardiac structure and warrant follow-up in future functional studies.

   abstract = {MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) is abundant in the liver and involved in lipid homeostasis, but its relevance to the long-term risk of developing metabolic disorders is unknown. We therefore measured circulating miR-122 in the prospective population-based Bruneck Study (n = 810; survey year 1995). Circulating miR-122 was associated with prevalent insulin resistance, obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and an adverse lipid profile. Among 92 plasma proteins and 135 lipid subspecies quantified with mass spectrometry, it correlated inversely with zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein and positively with afamin, complement factor H, VLDL-associated apolipoproteins, and lipid subspecies containing monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids. Proteomics analysis of livers from antagomiR-122-treated mice revealed novel regulators of hepatic lipid metabolism that are responsive to miR-122 inhibition. In the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT, n = 155), 12-month atorvastatin reduced circulating miR-122. A similar response to atorvastatin was observed in mice and cultured murine hepatocytes. Over up to 15 years of follow-up in the Bruneck Study, multivariable adjusted risk ratios per one-SD higher log miR-122 were 1.60 (95% CI 1.30-1.96; P < 0.001) for metabolic syndrome and 1.37 (1.03-1.82; P = 0.021) for type 2 diabetes. In conclusion, circulating miR-122 is strongly associated with the risk of developing metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes in the general population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Statins reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in people with hypertension. This benefit could arise from a beneficial effect of statins on central aortic pressures and hemodynamics. The Conduit Artery Function Evaluation-Lipid-Lowering Arm (CAFE-LLA) study, an Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) substudy, investigated this hypothesis in a prospective placebo-controlled study of treated patients with hypertension. METHODS AND RESULTS: CAFE-LLA recruited 891 patients randomized to atorvastatin 10 mg/d or placebo from 5 centers in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Radial artery applanation tonometry and pulse-wave analysis were used to derive central aortic pressures and hemodynamic indices at repeated visits over 3.5 years of follow-up. Atorvastatin lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 32.4 mg/dL (95% confidence interval [CI], 28.6 to 36.3) and total cholesterol by 35.1 mg/dL (95% confidence interval, 30.9 to 39.4) relative to placebo. Time-averaged brachial blood pressure was similar in CAFE-LLA patients randomized to atorvastatin or placebo (change in brachial systolic blood pressure, -0.1 mm Hg [95% CI, -1.8 to 1.6], P=0.9; change in brachial pulse pressure, -0.02 mm Hg [95% CI, -1.6 to 1.6], P=0.9). Atorvastatin did not influence central aortic pressures (change in aortic systolic blood pressure, -0.5 mm Hg [95% CI, -2.3 to 1.2], P=0.5; change in aortic pulse pressure, -0.4 mm Hg [95% CI, -1.9 to 1.0], P=0.6) and had no influence on augmentation index (change in augmentation index, -0.4%; 95% CI, -1.7 to 0.8; P=0.5) or heart rate (change in heart rate, 0.25 bpm; 95% CI, -1.3 to 1.8; P=0.7) compared with placebo. The effect of statin or placebo therapy was not modified by the blood pressure-lowering treatment strategy in the factorial design. CONCLUSIONS: Statin therapy sufficient to significantly reduce cardiovascular events in treated hypertensive patients in ASCOT did not influence central aortic blood pressure or hemodynamics in a large representative cohort of ASCOT patients in CAFE-LLA.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Different blood pressure (BP)-lowering drugs could have different effects on central aortic pressures and thus cardiovascular outcome despite similar effects on brachial BP. The Conduit Artery Function Evaluation (CAFE) study, a substudy of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), examined the impact of 2 different BP lowering-regimens (atenolol+/-thiazide-based versus amlodipine+/-perindopril-based therapy) on derived central aortic pressures and hemodynamics. METHODS AND RESULTS: The CAFE study recruited 2199 patients in 5 ASCOT centers. Radial artery applanation tonometry and pulse wave analysis were used to derive central aortic pressures and hemodynamic indexes on repeated visits for up to 4 years. Most patients received combination therapy throughout the study. Despite similar brachial systolic BPs between treatment groups (Delta0.7 mm Hg; 95% CI, -0.4 to 1.7; P=0.2), there were substantial reductions in central aortic pressures with the amlodipine regimen (central aortic systolic BP, Delta4.3 mm Hg; 95% CI, 3.3 to 5.4; P<0.0001; central aortic pulse pressure, Delta3.0 mm Hg; 95% CI, 2.1 to 3.9; P<0.0001). Cox proportional-hazards modeling showed that central pulse pressure was significantly associated with a post hoc-defined composite outcome of total cardiovascular events/procedures and development of renal impairment in the CAFE cohort (unadjusted, P<0.0001; adjusted for baseline variables, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: BP-lowering drugs can have substantially different effects on central aortic pressures and hemodynamics despite a similar impact on brachial BP. Moreover, central aortic pulse pressure may be a determinant of clinical outcomes, and differences in central aortic pressures may be a potential mechanism to explain the different clinical outcomes between the 2 BP treatment arms in ASCOT.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Weight and health behaviours are known to affect physical disability; however the evidence exploring the impact of changes to these lifestyle factors over the life course on disability is inconsistent. We aimed to explore the roles of weight and activity change between mid and later life on physical disability. METHODS: Baseline and 20-year clinical follow-up data were collected from 1418 men and women, aged 58-88 years at follow-up, as part of a population-based observational study based in north-west London. At clinic, behavioural data were collected by questionnaire and anthropometry measured. Disability was assessed using a performance-based locomotor function test and self-reported questionnaires on functional limitation and basic activities of daily living (ADLs). RESULTS: At follow-up, 39% experienced a locomotor dysfunction, 24% a functional limitation and 17% an impairment of ADLs. Weight gain of 10-20% or >20% of baseline, but not weight loss, were associated with increased odds of a functional limitation [odds ratio (OR) 1.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14-2.49 and OR 2.74, 1.55-4.83, respectively], after full adjustment for covariates. The same patterns were seen for the other disability outcomes. Increased physical activity reduced, and decreased physical activity enhanced the likelihood of disability, independent of baseline behaviours and adiposity. The adverse effects of weight gain appeared to be lessened in the presence of increased later-life physical activity. CONCLUSION: Weight and activity changes between mid and later life have strong implications for physical functioning in older groups. These findings reinforce the importance of the maintenance of healthy weight and behaviour throughout the life course, and the need to promote healthy lifestyles across population groups.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite elevated risk profiles for depression among South Asian and Black Caribbean people in the UK, prevalences of late-life depressive symptoms across the UK's three major ethnic groups have not been well characterized. METHOD: Data were collected at baseline and 20-year follow-up from 632 European, 476 South Asian and 181 Black Caribbean men and women (aged 58-88 years), of a community-based cohort study from north-west London. The 10-item Geriatric Depression Scale was interviewer-administered during a clinic visit (depressive symptoms defined as a score of 4 out of 10), with clinical data (adiposity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cognitive function) also collected. Sociodemographic, psychosocial, behavioural, disability, and medical history information was obtained by questionnaire. RESULTS: Prevalence of depressive symptoms varied by ethnic group, affecting 9.7% of White European, 15.5% of South Asian, and 17.7% of Black Caribbean participants. Compared with White Europeans, South Asian and Black Caribbean participants were significantly more likely to have depressive symptoms (odds ratio 1.79, 95% confidence interval 1.24-2.58 and 1.80, 1.11-2.92, respectively). Adjustment for co-morbidities had most effect on the excess South Asian odds, and adjustment for socioeconomic position had most effect on the elevated Black Caribbean odds. CONCLUSIONS: Higher prevalence of depressive symptoms observed among South Asian people were attenuated after adjustment for physical health, whereas the Black Caribbean increased prevalence was most explained by socioeconomic disadvantage. It is important to understand the reasons for these ethnic differences to identify opportunities for interventions to address inequalities.},

   abstract = {1. Pre-eclampsia is associated with elevated proinflammatory cytokine levels and endothelial dysfunction. This study examined the effect of two cytokines, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1) on endothelium-dependent relaxation in response to acetylcholine (ACH), bradykinin (BK) and histamine (HIS) in rat mesenteric small arteries in vitro. 2. Rat mesenteric arteries were mounted in an isometric myograph. Tone was induced with phenylephrine (PE) or a depolarizing solution containing 80 mM KCl (K(80)). Relaxation was measured in response to ACH, BK, HIS and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), an endothelium-independent relaxant. Inhibition of NO synthase by a combination of N(omega)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) and N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) significantly inhibited relaxation in response to ACH and BK. Addition of an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, indomethacin, had no additional effect when added to L-NMMA and L-NAME. Inhibition of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) by K(80) partially reduced responses to ACH and BK. Inhibition of HIS-induced relaxation was more marked with K(80). L-NMMA and L-NAME largely abolished the remaining relaxation to ACH, BK and HIS in arteries contracted with K(80). 3. Preincubation with TNF for 30 min caused an inhibition of relaxation in response to ACH and BK in arteries contracted with PE. Responses to HIS and SNP were not affected by TNF under these conditions. TNF also inhibited ACH-induced relaxation in arteries contracted with K(80). IL-1 had no effect on responses to ACH and the combination of TNF and IL-1 was not more effective than TNF alone. 4. The inhibitory effect of TNF on ACH-induced relaxation was abolished by coincubation with superoxide dismutase (SOD) and was not seen if NO synthase was inhibited by L-NMMA and L-NAME. 5. TNF inhibits the NO-dependent component of endothelium-dependent relaxation in response to ACH and BK, but does not inhibit the EDHF-dependent component. This effect may be attributable to the ability of TNF to increase levels of superoxide anions (O(2)(-)) and the ability of O(2)(-) to inactivate NO. This mechanism could contribute to the endothelial dysfunction seen in situations where TNF is elevated, such as pre-eclampsia.},

In our cohort study of 214 pregnant women with HIV-1 infection, those who received no antiretroviral therapy had a rate of pre-eclampsia significantly lower (none of 61) than those on triple antiretroviral therapy (8 of 76; odds ratio 15.3, 95% CI 0.9-270, p=0.0087). However, the rate of pre-eclampsia in HIV-1-positive women on treatment did not differ from that in uninfected controls (12 of 214; p=0.2). The association of HIV-1-related immune deficiency with a low rate of pre-eclampsia, and the restoration of this rate in women treated with triple antiretroviral therapy to the expected rate indicates a pivotal role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. The clinical presentation of pre-eclampsia and toxic effects of antiretroviral therapy could overlap and complicate diagnosis and management in these patients.},

   abstract = {Endothelin-1 (ET-1) has been proposed to contribute to the regulation of vascular tone in humans. BQ-123, an ET(A) receptor antagonist, has also been reported to increase forearm blood flow (FBF) in vivo; however, the efficacy of BQ-123 as an antagonist of ET-1 has not been evaluated in the forearm. The present study investigated the effects of BQ-123 on changes in FBF in response to ET-1 and noradrenaline (NA; norepinephrine), taking into account the possible influence of vasodilator effects of BQ-123 on responses to vasoconstrictors. Six subjects (age 25-34 years) participated in a double-blind randomized study. FBF was measured by forearm occlusion plethysmography. Drugs were infused intra-arterially into the non-dominant arm (study arm) on four separate occasions; the non-infused arm was used as a control. The effects of BQ-123 (50 nmol/min for 60 min, or 300 nmol/min for 5 min followed by saline for 55 min) were compared with the effects of infusion of sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 12 nmol/min for 60 min) or saline on vasoconstriction induced by ET-1 (10 pmol/min for 7 min) and NA (120 pmol/min for 7 min). Infusion of BQ-123 at either dose did not significantly increase FBF, whereas SNP increased FBF by 134% (P=0.03). ET-1 significantly reduced FBF, and this effect was almost completely inhibited by both doses of BQ-123, but was unaffected by SNP. NA also reduced FBF, and this action was unaffected by BQ-123 or SNP. The data show that BQ-123 is a selective ET-1 antagonist, but do not confirm a major role for ET-1 in influencing resting forearm vascular tone in young normotensive subjects.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Preeclampsia is a common and serious complication of pregnancy, characterized by maternal hypertension and proteinuria, placental insufficiency, and fetal growth restriction. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether intracellular Ca 2+ ([Ca 2+ ] i ) and contractile responses of vascular smooth muscle to vasoactive agents are altered in preeclampsia compared with normal pregnancy and the nonpregnant state. STUDY DESIGN: Subcutaneous and myometrial resistance arteries from women who had preeclampsia, normal pregnancy, and nonpregnant women were obtained at the time of cesarean section or hysterectomy. Arteries were mounted on an isometric myograph and loaded with the Ca 2+ indicator, fura-2AM, to permit simultaneous measurement of force and [Ca 2+ ] i . Reponses to endothelium-dependent relaxants (acetylcholine and substance P) and vasoconstrictors (depolarizing potassium solution, phenylephrine, and angiotensin II) were examined. RESULTS: The fall in [Ca 2+ ] i and relaxation in response to acetylcholine was significantly inhibited in both myometrial and subcutaneous arteries from preeclamptic women compared with arteries from nonpregnant or normal pregnant women. However, responses to substance P did not differ between the 3 groups. There were no significant differences in [Ca 2+ ] i or force responses to high potassium, phenylephrine, or angiotensin II in myometrial and subcutaneous resistance vessels in women with preeclampsia compared with normal pregnant women. However, force, but not [Ca 2+ ] i responses to angiotensin II, in subcutaneous vessels from normal pregnant and preeclamptic women were reduced compared with subcutaneous arteries from nonpregnant women, indicating that pregnancy is associated with a reduction in Ca 2+ sensitization in this tissue. A similar effect was not seen in myometrial arteries. CONCLUSION: Endothelial function is altered in preeclampsia, with loss of effect of acetylcholine, but not substance P. Vasoconstrictor reactivity is not increased in preeclampsia compared with uncomplicated normal pregnancy, and this is unlikely to be an explanation for the increased peripheral vascular resistance seen in preeclampsia.},

This study investigated whether there is an abnormality of intracellular calcium ([Ca2=]i) and tension during recovery from activation in isolated resistance arteries in preeclampsia and investigated the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Subcutaneous and myometrial resistance arteries from preeclamptic, normotensive pregnant and nonpregnant women were mounted on an isometric myograph and loaded with fura-2 to allow simultaneous measurement of force and [Ca2+]i. Arteries were activated by a high-potassium solution or noradrenaline, and the rate of decline in force and [Ca2+]i examined following washout. RESULTS: Basal tone and [Ca2+]i and rise in force and [Ca2+]i induced by high-potassium solution did not differ between groups but the rate of decline after washout was significantly slowed in both subcutaneous and myometrial arteries from preeclamptic women as compared with normotensive pregnant or nonpregnant women. The rate of decline in force after noradrenaline was also slowed in arteries from preeclamptic women. In subcutaneous resistance arteries from nonpregnant women, removal of the endothelium did not affect the rate of decline in force after high-potassium solution. However, inhibition of the plasma membrane Ca ATPase with carboxyeosin mimicked the findings seen in preeclampsia. In contrast, inhibition of the sarcoplasmic endoreticulum Ca ATPase with cyclopiazonic acid had no effect on the rate of decline in force or [Ca2+]i. CONCLUSION: The rate of relaxation and decline in [Ca2+]i in resistance arteries are impaired in preeclampsia. This may be mediated by decreased activity of plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase and could be a mechanism contributing to elevated peripheral resistance and raised blood pressure in preeclampsia.},

   abstract = {Abnormalities of the retinal microcirculation are found in hypertension and diabetes and predict cardiovascular mortality. This study examined the relationship between abnormalities of the retinal microvasculature and death from ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke. A population-based, nested case-control study was undertaken within the Beaver Dam Eye Study. Subjects (43 to 74 years) who died of IHD (n=126) or stroke (n=28) over a 10-year period were age and gender matched with controls subjects (n=528; case:control matching, approximately 1:4). Retinal photographs of cases and controls were digitized and analyzed using a computer-based technique. Increased risk of IHD death was associated with a suboptimal relationship of arteriolar diameters at bifurcation (P=0.02 unadjusted) and decreased retinal arteriolar tortuosity (P=0.011 unadjusted). These associations remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, past history of cardiovascular disease, and other known cardiovascular risk factors. Increased arteriolar length:diameter ratio, a measure of generalized arteriolar narrowing, was associated with increased stroke mortality (P=0.02 unadjusted). This association was independent of age and gender but was attenuated by adjustment for systolic blood pressure (P=0.15). Other quantitative measures of the retinal microvascular network (eg, venular tortuosity and arteriolar and venular bifurcation angle) were not associated with death from IHD or stroke. Retinal microvascular abnormalities are predictive of death from IHD and stroke. A detailed assessment of the retinal microvascular network from digitized photographs may be useful in the noninvasive assessment of target organ damage and cardiovascular risk.},

However, the junction exponent is normally calculated iteratively from diameter measurements, and Monte-Carlo simulation studies show the junction exponent to be biased in the presence of measurement noise.We present an alternative parameter, referred to as optimality ratio, that is simpler to compute and also more robust in the presence of noise.To demonstrate the sensitivity of the optimality ratio to alterations in topography of the retinal vascular network, we analysed the effect of inducing endothelial dysfunction by infusion of NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, compared to placebo in a double-blind crossover study. The optimality ratio showed a significant increase (p = 0.03) during infusion of l-NMMA compared to placebo.We propose that a measure of the extent of departure of optimality ratio from its optimal value of 2(-1/3) may be a useful indicator of microvascular endothelial dysfunction in vivo.},

   abstract = {Atherosclerosis in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) resulting in peripheral arterial disease is more common in men than women and shows a predilection for the region of the adductor canal. Blood flow patterns are related to development of atherosclerosis, and we investigated if curvature and tortuosity of the femoral artery differed between young men and women and if differences resulted in adverse flow patterns. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) were combined in 18 young adult volunteers (9 men) to assess the relationship of flow features to likely sites of future atherosclerosis formation. Subjects underwent MRI of the right SFA, three-dimensional vascular geometry was reconstructed, and measures of tortuosity and curvature were calculated. Tortuosity and curvature were significantly greater for men than women, and this was related to increased body surface area, body mass index, or weight in men. In both sexes, "tortuosity" increased from the midthigh to the popliteal fossa. The greatest curvature was found within the distal quarter of the SFA. CFD modeling was undertaken on MRI-based reconstructions of the SFA. Wall shear stresses (WSS) were extracted from the computations. WSS showed greater spatial variation in the men than in the women, and the men exhibited lower mean WSS. These data indicate that sex differences related to body size and anatomical course of the femoral artery may contribute to the enhanced risk of focal atherosclerosis in the adductor canal.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput profiling of circulating metabolites may improve cardiovascular risk prediction over established risk factors. METHODS AND RESULTS: We applied quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics to identify the biomarkers for incident cardiovascular disease during long-term follow-up. Biomarker discovery was conducted in the National Finnish FINRISK study (n=7256; 800 events). Replication and incremental risk prediction was assessed in the Southall and Brent Revisited (SABRE) study (n=2622; 573 events) and British Women's Health and Heart Study (n=3563; 368 events). In targeted analyses of 68 lipids and metabolites, 33 measures were associated with incident cardiovascular events at P<0.0007 after adjusting for age, sex, blood pressure, smoking, diabetes mellitus, and medication. When further adjusting for routine lipids, 4 metabolites were associated with future cardiovascular events in meta-analyses: higher serum phenylalanine (hazard ratio per standard deviation, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.24; P=4x10(-10)) and monounsaturated fatty acid levels (1.17; 1.11-1.24; P=1x10(-8)) were associated with increased cardiovascular risk, while higher omega-6 fatty acids (0.89; 0.84-0.94; P=6x10(-5)) and docosahexaenoic acid levels (0.90; 0.86-0.95; P=5x10(-5)) were associated with lower risk. A risk score incorporating these 4 biomarkers was derived in FINRISK. Risk prediction estimates were more accurate in the 2 validation cohorts (relative integrated discrimination improvement, 8.8% and 4.3%), albeit discrimination was not enhanced. Risk classification was particularly improved for persons in the 5% to 10% risk range (net reclassification, 27.1% and 15.5%). Biomarker associations were further corroborated with mass spectrometry in FINRISK (n=671) and the Framingham Offspring Study (n=2289). CONCLUSIONS: Metabolite profiling in large prospective cohorts identified phenylalanine, monounsaturated fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids as biomarkers for cardiovascular risk. This study substantiates the value of high-throughput metabolomics for biomarker discovery and improved risk assessment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Statins are first-line therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention, but their systemic effects across lipoprotein subclasses, fatty acids, and circulating metabolites remain incompletely characterized. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the molecular effects of statin therapy on multiple metabolic pathways. METHODS: Metabolic profiles based on serum nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics were quantified at 2 time points in 4 population-based cohorts from the United Kingdom and Finland (N = 5,590; 2.5 to 23.0 years of follow-up). Concentration changes in 80 lipid and metabolite measures during follow-up were compared between 716 individuals who started statin therapy and 4,874 persistent nonusers. To further understand the pharmacological effects of statins, we used Mendelian randomization to assess associations of a genetic variant known to mimic inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase (the intended drug target) with the same lipids and metabolites for 27,914 individuals from 8 population-based cohorts. RESULTS: Starting statin therapy was associated with numerous lipoprotein and fatty acid changes, including substantial lowering of remnant cholesterol (80% relative to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]), but only modest lowering of triglycerides (25% relative to LDL-C). Among fatty acids, omega-6 levels decreased the most (68% relative to LDL-C); other fatty acids were only modestly affected. No robust changes were observed for circulating amino acids, ketones, or glycolysis-related metabolites. The intricate metabolic changes associated with statin use closely matched the association pattern with rs12916 in the HMGCR gene (R(2) = 0.94, slope 1.00 +/- 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Statin use leads to extensive lipid changes beyond LDL-C and appears efficacious for lowering remnant cholesterol. Metabolomic profiling, however, suggested minimal effects on amino acids. The results exemplify how detailed metabolic characterization of genetic proxies for drug targets can inform indications, pleiotropic effects, and pharmacological mechanisms.},

   abstract = {The study of wave propagation at different points in the arterial circulation may provide useful information regarding ventriculoarterial interactions. We describe a number of hemodynamic parameters in the carotid, brachial, and radial arteries of normal subjects by using noninvasive techniques and wave-intensity analysis (WIA). Twenty-one normal adult subjects (14 men and 7 women, mean age 44 +/- 6 yr) underwent applanation tonometry and pulsed-wave Doppler studies of the right common carotid, brachial, and radial arteries. After ensemble averaging of the pressure and flow-velocity data, local hydraulic work was determined and a pressure-flow velocity loop was used to determine local wave speed. WIA was then applied to determine the magnitude, timings, and energies of individual waves. At all sites, forward-traveling (S) and backward-traveling (R) compression waves were observed in early systole. In mid- and late systole, forward-traveling expansion waves (X and D) were also seen. Wave speed was significantly higher in the brachial (6.97 +/- 0.58 m/s) and radial (6.78 +/- 0.62 m/s) arteries compared with the carotid artery (5.40 +/- 0.34 m/s; P < 0.05). S-wave energy was greatest in the brachial artery (993.5 +/- 87.8 mJ/m2), but R-wave energy was greatest in the radial artery (176.9 +/- 19.9 mJ/m2). X-wave energy was significantly higher in the brachial and radial arteries (176.4 +/- 32.7 and 163.2 +/- 30.5 mJ/m2, respectively) compared with the carotid artery (41.0 +/- 9.4 mJ/m2; P < 0.001). WIA illustrates important differences in wave patterns between peripheral arteries and may provide a method for understanding ventriculo-arterial interactions in the time domain.},

Using this tool, we have developed non-invasive techniques to study wave transmission in both central & peripheral arteries in man. The aim of this study was to determine the reproducibility of various haemodynamic measures in the carotid, brachial and radial arteries.
12 treated hypertensive men underwent applanation tonometry and pulsed Doppler ultrasound studies of the carotid, brachial and radial arteries on 2 occasions. Coefficients of variation for the local wave speed, cardiac compression wave intensity and main reflected wave intensity ranged between 3.7-6.6%, 8.2-11.4% and 12.5-19.6% respectively.
We conclude that non-invasive methods used for wave intensity analysis are reproducible & provide additional information regarding the complex phenomenon of arterial wave transmission in man.},

   abstract = {It is generally believed that thermal sensitive liposomes (i.e. vesicles) that contain 1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethyleneglycol)-20 00 (DSPE.2000) maintain a constant permeability to ionic molecules when they are heated to the phase transition temperature of the membrane (Tm). However, DPPC:DSPE.2000 liposome systems have been reported to release encapsulated agent in a "pseudoequilibrium" pattern upon temperature rise, whereby there is a rapid release of encapsulated material followed by no further release. Little effort has been made to determine the mechanism of such release behavior. We aim to explore the potential cause of "pseudoequilibrium" release of DPPC:DSPE.2000 liposome systems in response to temperature rise. Using calcein as a hydrophilic marker, the release pattern of DPPC:DSPE.2000 liposome system at Tm has been carefully determined. The potential mechanism of its release behavior has been further explored using two novel assays (i.e. heating-cooling-reheating assay and incubation assay). Our results show that there is a dramatic enhancement of the permeability of DPPC:DSPE.2000 vesicles to ionized molecules (i.e. calcein) during the initial period of heating to 42 degrees C. This is believed to result from the opening of the hydrophilic pores at the liquid/solid interface. However, after less than 2 min of incubation at this temperature, no further release of calcein is observed, suggesting that the sizes of pores are reduced, restricting any further movement of calcein molecules. On cooling and reheating the DPPC:DSPE.2000 liposomes to 42 degrees C, no further release of calcein is observed. The incorporation of MSPC (1-stearoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) extends the release period of calcein from the DPPC:MSPC:DSPE.2000 vesicles to more than 30 min, suggesting that the lysolipid stabilizes the pores in the lipid membrane.},

Our objective was to quantify these parameters in normal subjects in a clinical setting, and to define regions of low wall shear stress and high mechanical stress. The right carotid bifurcations of five healthy male volunteers were investigated using a novel non-invasive technique which integrates magnetic resonance angiography, ultrasonography, tonometry and state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics and solid mechanics models. Significant inter-subject variations in patterns as well as magnitude of wall shear stress and mechanical stress were found. In spite of individual variabilities, this study revealed that some regions of the artery wall are exposed simultaneously to low wall shear stress and high mechanical stress and that these regions correspond to areas where atherosclerotic plaque develops. The coexistence of regions of low wall shear stress and high tensile stress may be an important determinant of the formation of atheroma in human arteries.},

   abstract = {A comprehensive coupled fluid-wall interaction dynamics model was developed for the simulation of blood flow in arteries. Blood flow was treated as pulsatile, laminar, Newtonian and incompressible. The structural model accounted for both material and geometric nonlinearities. A multiblock body fitted grid was used to subdivide the flow domain into computational finite Volume cells. Shell elements were used to discretize the arterial wall. A finite volume computational fluid dynamics code and a finite element structural dynamics code were used to solve the how and structure equations, respectively. This paper discusses some important issues related to the coupled model, particularly numerical convergence. In addition to convergence considerations within each code, convergence between the two codes must also be dealt with. And a relaxation technique has been introduced to improve and accelerate the convergence performance.},

   abstract = {The superior thyroid artery was ignored in previous fluid dynamics studies of carotid bifurcations. However, it is not clear to what extent the flow patterns within the carotid might be influenced by the presence of this outflow tract in reality. In this study, quantitative effects of the superior thyroid artery upon the flow patterns and wall shear stress in the carotid bifurcation were investigated in detail by a numerical simulation method. Comparisons of the maximum reversed flow velocities, flow patterns and wall shear stress were made between models with and without the superior thyroid artery. Results demonstrate that this small artery has only a marginal effect on the overall flow characteristics within the carotid sinus. However, it does have significant effects on flow patterns in the common-external side branch. An alternative approach is proposed to compensate for the absence of this small artery in numerical calculations.},

   abstract = {The pulsatile flow in an anatomically realistic compliant human carotid bifurcation was simulated numerically. Pressure and mass flow waveforms in the carotid arteries were obtained from an individual subject using non-invasive techniques. The geometry of the computational model was reconstructed from magnetic resonance angiograms. Maps of time-average wall shear stress, contours of velocity in the flow field as well as wall movement and tensile stress on the arterial wall are all presented. Inconsistent with previous findings from idealised geometry models, flow in the carotid sinus is dominated by a strong helical flow accompanied by a single secondary vortex motion. This type of flow is induced primarily by the asymmetry and curvature of the in vivo geometry. Flow simulations have been carried out under the rigid wall assumption and for the compliant wall, respectively. Comparison of the results demonstrates the quantitative influence of the vessel wall motion. Generally there is a reduction in the magnitude of wall shear stress, with its degree depending on location and phase of the cardiac cycle. The region of slow or reversed flow was greater, in both spatial and temporal terms in the compliant model, but the global characteristics of the flow and stress patterns remain unchanged. The analysis of mechanical stresses on the vessel surface shows a complicated stress field. Stress concentration occurs at both the anterior and posterior aspects of the proximal internal bulb. These are also regions of low wall shear stress. The comparison of computed and measured wall movement generally shows good agreement.},
